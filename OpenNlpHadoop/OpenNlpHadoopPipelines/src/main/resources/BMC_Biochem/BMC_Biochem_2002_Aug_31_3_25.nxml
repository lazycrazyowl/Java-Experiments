A&#x003b2; arises from cleavage of the Amyloid Precursor protein by &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; secretases, which present attractive candidates for therapeutic targeting. Two &#x003b2;-secretase candidates, ASP-1 and ASP-2, were identified as aspartic proteases, both of which cleave the amyloid precursor at the &#x003b2;-site. These are produced as immature transmembrane proteins containing a pro-segment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>ASP-2 expressed in HEK293-cells cleaved the Swedish mutant amyloid precursor at different &#x003b2;-sites at different pHs <italic>in vitro</italic>. Recent reports show that furin cleaves the pro-peptide of ASP-2, whereas ASP-1 undergoes auto-catalysis. We show that purified recombinant ASP-2 cleaves its own pro-peptide at ph 5 but not pH  8.5 as seen by mass spectrometry, electrophoresis and N-terminal sequencing.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We suggest that ASP-2 processing as well as activity are influenced by pH, and hence the cellular localisation of the protein may have profound effects on the production of A&#x003b2;. These factors should be taken into consideration in the design of potential inhibitors for these enzymes.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Alzheimer's disease is a common age-related dementia which is characterised pathologically by the appearance of brain senile plaques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] composed primarily of aggregated forms of A&#x003b2;. These are 39&#x02013;43 residue peptides released following proteolytic processing of the transmembrane precursor glycoprotein, APP. The amyloidogenic pathway requires the APP to be sequentially cleaved by &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; secretases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. &#x003b2;-Secretase cleaves APP close to the membrane to produce &#x003b2;APPs (secreted), and the 12-kDa, C100 transmembrane stub, subsequently cleaved by &#x003b3;-secretase to produce the A&#x003b2; peptide and a cytoplasmic fragment with very short half life. &#x003b1;-Secretase cleaves APP within the A&#x003b2; sequence thus preventing its formation producing the N-terminal &#x003b1;APPs domain and the 10-kDa membrane-localised C-terminal stub, C83. As aggregated A&#x003b2; is thought to promote neuronal death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], the secretases represent potential drug targets for the treatment and/or prevention of AD. Presenilin-1 was suggested to be the ideal candidate for &#x003b3;-secretase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] whereas &#x003b1;-secretase has been characterised as ADAM10 disintegrin and metalloprotease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Recently, several groups used expression cloning, genomic search, or purification and proteomic analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] to clone and identify &#x003b2;-secretase as an aspartic endopeptidase (EC 3.4.23) named BACE (&#x003b2;-site APP clevage enzyme), ASP-2 (aspartic protease 2), or memapsin 1. An additional candidate, ASP-1, BACE-2 or memapsin-2, has also been cloned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The ASP-2 gene codes for a signal peptide, a pro-peptide (22-TQHGIRLPLRSGLGGAPLGLRLPR-46), followed by the catalytic domain, a transmembrane segment and a cytoplasmic C-terminal tail. Several cysteine residues are present, six of which are in the lumenal domain which may form intramolecular disulphide bridges contributing to the folding of the active site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Both ASP-1 and -2 are extensively glycosylated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and phosphorylated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and contain S-palmitoyl groups which may aid membrane anchorage[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Nearly all aspartic proteinases (EC 3.4.23.X) are synthesized as zymogens which are converted to active enzymes at acidic pH by proteolytic cleavage of the pro-segment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. This process is autocatalytic for some pro-enzymes such as pepsinogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and cathepsins D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and E [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Furin is thought to cleave the ASP-2 pro-domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], though other pro-protein convertases were effective as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In contrast, ASP-1 has been demonstrated to cleave its own pro-peptide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Although the pro-sequences of ASP-1 and ASP-2 are dissimilar we investigated whether ASP-2 also cleaves its pro-peptide. The activity of ASP-2 was assessed using the Swedish mutant form of APP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] which is more readily cleaved by &#x003b2;-secretase than the wild type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. We investigated the effects of pH on ASP-2 processing and activity. We report that pH affects the pro-domain removal of ASP-2 <italic>in vitro</italic> as well as its site of &#x003b2;-secretase cleavage in APP to produce A&#x003b2;.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Expression and Ni<sup>2+</sup>-affinity purification of recombinant ASP-1 and ASP-2 in HEK293 cells</title><p>HEK293 cells were transfected with the &#x003b2;-secretase candidates ASP-1 or ASP-2 pcDNA3.1<italic>myc</italic>His clones and selected for stable transfection with Geneticin (800 &#x003bc;g/ml). HEK293 cell lines have been used by others to overexpress these enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and have also been used to study the effects of &#x003b2;-secretase cleavage on recombinant APP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Cell lysates from positive clones were analysed by SDS-PAGE and western blotting with an anti-<italic>myc</italic> antibody to detect the recombinant ASP-1 and ASP-2 proteins. The <italic>myc</italic> epitope is encoded in frame downstream of the C-terminal of the proteins followed by a 6-Histidine tag for affinity purification. Both recombinant ASP-1 and ASP-2 were expressed and detected by western blotting as 55&#x02013;70-k and 65&#x02013;80-k bands, respectively, higher than the estimated molecular weights of the pro-apoproteins (53.4 and 53.7-kDa including the pro-peptide domains), mainly due to glycosylation as predicted by their amino acid sequences and shown in recent reports by Charlwood <italic>et al</italic>., 2001. Recombinant ASP-2 was purified by Ni<sup>2+</sup>-affinity chromatography. Silver-stained SDS-PAGE confirmed the purity of ASP-2 from other contaminants as seen in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>; lower bands (dotted arrows) seen in the purified preparation are due to artefactual materials also present in the negative control sample (note the presence of higher molecular weight forms of ASP-2). Immunoblotting of the same preparation of ASP-2 detected with the anti-myc antibody, (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1, 1B</xref>) confirms purification of ASP-2. The most prevalent of these ASP-2 proteins was a 75-k band. We used an affinity-purified antibody raised against the C-terminal peptide of ASP-2 (anti-ASP-2) to characterise the recombinant proteins. This antibody was specific for ASP-2 and did not cross-react with ASP-1 or other cellular proteins as characterised by ELISA and western blotting.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Ni<sup>2+</sup>-affinity purification of ASP-2.</bold> A detergent extract was prepared from a total of 50 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>ASP-2-transfected cells as described in the methods, in the presence of protease inhibitors and loaded on an equilibrated Ni<sup>2+</sup>-charged agarose column, following dilution of the lysate to 0.5% (wt/vol) detergent and pure protein was eluted in fractions of 1 ml with 300 mM imidazole solution with 0.1% detergent. Eluates were loaded on a SDS-PAGE and proteins were detected by silver staining, (panel A) and anti-<italic>myc</italic> antibody developed by ECL (Panel B). Molecular weight standards are indicated in the first lane whereas the last lane shows a sample of elution buffer in loading buffer without protein. Typically, 20% yield was recovered following purification, amounting to approximately 40&#x02013;60 &#x003bc;g of protein for a preparation from 50 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells.

When increased amounts of protein were loaded (as in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2, 2A</xref>) the anti-ASP-2 IgG detected ASP-2 bands of higher Mw, larger than 200-k or at M<italic>r</italic>~140-k, shown with triple and double arrows, respectively; the 140 k band was also visible by silver staining as indicated by the double arrow in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>. These correspond in size to three or two ASP-2 molecules, respectively, implying ASP-2 oligomerisation into a trimer and dimer. The sensitivity of the putative dimer (140-k) to PNGase resulted in a reduction of size by ~30-k, to yield a band migrating as 100-k, equivalent to the behaviour of 2 linked monomers. Reduction with DTT and &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2, 2B</xref>) almost completely removed the ~200-k protein and increased the intensity of the 75-k band, but failed to affect the appearance of the putative dimer (140-k) suggesting strong intramolecular interactions. The oligomers were visible in freshly produced and purified ASP-2, though the 200-k protein was more prominent (data not shown) upon longer storage and at higher protein concentrations indicating that this was partly due to non-specific aggregation. An additional observation was the delayed mobility of ASP-2 in reducing conditions (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2, 2B</xref>) which is possibly due to loss of globular structure during reduction of intramolecular disulphide links described previously by Haniu <italic>et al</italic>., 2000.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>ASP-2 post-translational modifications; glycosylation and disulphide linkages</bold><bold>Panel A</bold>: ASP-2 samples were denatured by boiling in the presence of SDS and prior to treatment with PNGase, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Glycosylated and deglycosylated samples are depicted. A reduction in size of ~15-k is seen in the presence of PNGase due to the removal of N-linked sugars. Note the presence of higher ASP-2 bands, indicated with double arrows, which are similarly, deglycosylated. <bold>Panel B</bold>: ASP-2 samples were denatured in the presence or absence of a mixture of 10 mM DTT and 2% (vol/vol) &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol designated as reducing agent. A reduction in the amount of the largest ASP-2 protein (marked with 3 arrows) is noted in the presence of reducing agent as well as a reduction in the mobility of ASP-2 proteins. Ni<sup>2+</sup>-affinity purified ASP-2 was used at a concentration of 40 nM. Western blots were detected with anti-ASP-2.

Pure ASP-2 was dialysed into a buffer of ph 5 or pH 8.5, immediately following purification. Incubation of the protein at room temperature was carried out prior to PAGE analysis. A sample before dialysis was also analysed alongside the ASP-2 at pH 8.5 and ph 5. A western blot analysis of these samples, depicted in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3, 3A</xref>, reveals a small shift in molecular weight of 3 k for the monomeric band and ~8 k for the dimer at ph 5. This was the first indication that cleavage of the pro-peptide (2.56 k) was occurring, which was also mirrored, by increased mobility in the putative dimer. PNGase treatment of the ph 5 and pH 8.5 ASP-2 samples revealed the deglycosylated proteins to be resolved in 3 and 2 bands (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3, 3B</xref>), respectively. The bands of the ph 5 sample were smaller (~3-k) than the ASP-2 bands in the pH 8.5 sample. The fact that PNGase did not reduce the ASP-2 protein to a single band of the unmodified protein is probably due to other modifications mentioned earlier, such as palmitoylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The triplet at ph 5 is consistent with deglycosylated proteins with the pro-segments removed (processed), with and without additional modifications. The highest band is possibly non-processed deglycosylated protein, because its intensity decreases upon incubation at 37&#x000b0;C.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Reduction in size of ASP-2 upon incubation at acidic pH proposes autocatalytic pro-peptide cleavage</bold><bold>Panel A</bold>: Pure ASP-2 samples were dialysed at ph 5 and pH 8.5 immediately following purification and subsequently incubated for 2 hrs at room temperature as described in the methods. The initial non-dialysed sample was also incubated before all the samples were all analysed by SDS-PAGE and western blotting. A reduction of the size of ASP-2, ph 5 was observed compared to the initial eluate and the pH 8.5 samples. Note the presence of higher Mw bands ~140-k which also displayed increased mobility at ph 5. <bold>Panel B:</bold> The same ASP-2 samples dialysed at different pH were treated with PNGase for better resolution of the protein bands. The samples dialysed at pH 5 were either not incubated (first two lanes) or pre-incubated before PNGAse treatment. These samples needed to be titrated to pH 8.5 before deglycosylation. Similarly samples at pH 8.5 were treated or not with PNGase as indicated on the figure. Compared to the respective sample at pH 8.5, the ph 5 deglycosylated ASP-2 reveals the lowest ASP-2 band visible on this blot at ~50-k, possibly mature protein without the pro-peptide and sugars, suggesting maturation of ASP-2. Pre-incubation of the sample at 37&#x000b0;C increased the intensity of this band compared to the samples that were not pre-incubated implying that its appearance is time-dependent on incubation of the protein at a certain pH. For both panels sizes of molecular weight standard proteins are indicated on the left. Both panels were probed with anti-ASP-2 IgG and developed with ECL.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2091-3-25-3"/></fig><p>Pure ASP-2 that had been incubated at ph 5 after adjustment of the pH with acetic acid was analysed by mass spectrometry to further detect the cleaved pro-peptide (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The sample dialysed at ph 5 could not be used since the small, cleaved fragments would have been dialysed out of the 4 k-exclusion membrane. Compared to pH 8.5 (profile B), the sample at ph 5 (profile A) displays two distinct peaks of size 1094 and 1352 Da. The peak at 1094 corresponds closely to the estimated m/z of the N-terminal fragment of the pro-sequence namely, QHGIRLPLR (1089Da) (the N-terminal fragment from the Pro-sequence from which the N-terminal T had been removed-as found by N-terminal sequencing-see below, P1) and the peak at 1352 corresponds to a dehydrated form (-18 mass) of the penultimate N-terminal fragment of the Pro-sequence, P2 SGLGGAPLGLRLPR (1364 Da) respectively.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Mass spectrometry of ASP-2 samples at ph 5 and 8.5</bold> Pure ASP-2 samples that were prepared as described were titrated to pH 5 and pH 8.5 and incubated at room temperature.

The pro-peptide has an estimated Mw = 2535-Da. the ph 5 contains two peaks of 1094.4 and 1352.3 that are not present at pH 8.5.

N-terminal sequencing of these protein preparations revealed the presence of two sequences in the pH 8.5 preparation, namely ETDEEPEE (mature protein starting at E46), and QHGIRL (immature protein with an intact pro-domain starting at Q23). The presence of protein without its pro-domain, within the pH 8.5 sample, is not surprising as this protein was purified from the cells which themselves are expected to process nascent ASP-2. In contrast, Edman degradation of the preparation at pH 5 gave the sequence ETDEEPEE, predominantly matured protein, which was produced by processing <italic>in vitro</italic> following purification and dialysis -at low pH, suggesting that pro-peptide cleavage of ASP-2 can occur at two sites by autocatalysis at ph 5 <italic>in vitro</italic>. To further ascertain autocatalytic cleavage we added EDTA to inhibit endogenous cleavage by furin-like proteases as well as the BACE inhibitor (H-Lys-Thr-Glu-Glu-Ile-Ser-Glu-Val-Asn-Sta-Val-Ala-Glu-Phe-OH, Bachem, UK) to the incubations at ph 5. Mass spectrometric analysis of those samples (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) showed that EDTA had no effect on the pro-peptide cleavage of ASP-2 as the previously identified peaks of 1094 and 1352 Da are still present in this sample as they are in the control which did not contain any inhibitor. Most importantly incubation of ASP-2 with the BACE inhibitor resulted in the disappearance of these peaks suggesting that pro-peptide cleavage is a result of autocatalysis.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>BACE inhibitor reduces pro-peptide cleavage of ASP-2 at pH 5</bold> Pro-peptide cleavage of ASP-2 results in two peaks of 1094.4 and 1352.3 not present in the sample incubated with the BACE inhibitor (Mw = 1651 g/mol). These peaks are present when ASP-2 was incubated with EDTA. Samples of pure ASP-2 were prepared as described. Titration to ph 5 was carried out at 4&#x000b0;C and immediately EDTA (5 mM) or BACE inhibitor (20 &#x003bc;M, according to the protocol in Hussain <italic>et al</italic>. 2001) were added. Control ASP-2 at ph 5 contained no inhibitor. The peak of 1750 seen in the BACE inhibitor sample is also present in the inhibitor profile (not shown) and in agreement with its molecular weight is the inhibitor itself; additional larger bands are also present the inhibitor control sample.

Initially [<sup>35</sup>S]-labelled C-terminal APPswe polypeptides were isolated by immunoprecipitation with anti-CT15 IgG and protein-A-agarose and resuspended in reaction buffer (pH 8.5) prior to the addition of ASP-2. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6, 6A</xref>, depicts an autoradiogram of a 16.5% Tris-Tricine gel where APPswe was incubated with or without ASP-2. In the absence of ASP-2 we noted the presence of a small band of ~9.25 (&#x000b1; 0.6, n = 3)-k corresponding to the C-83 APPswe fragment produced by endogenous &#x003b1;-secretase cleavage. The addition of ASP-2 resulted in an additional band at ~12.4-k consistent with the estimated size of the C-terminal stub after cleavage of &#x003b2;-secretase at the A&#x003b2; (1&#x02013;40/42) site. To confirm the identity of this band the same reactions were carried out with non-radiolabelled substrate and the proteolytic fragments were detected by western blotting using either the anti-CT15 antibody (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6, 6B</xref> top panels) or the 6E10 (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6, 6B</xref> bottom panels) antibody, specific for the N-terminal of A&#x003b2;. These reactions were carried out both at optimum pH for aspartic protease activity, pH 5, as well as at pH 8.5 for comparison and the whole sample was analysed. ASP-2 was also pre-incubated at the respective pH. The arrows indicate the &#x003b1;-secretase cleaved fraction to be present in both pH 8.5 and ph 5. Two fragments (12.39 (&#x000b1; 0.24, n = 3) and 10.43 (&#x000b1; 0.45, n = 3)-k, designated &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-C100 and &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-C90, respectively) appear from ASP-2 cleavage at ph 5, consistent with fragments occurring by &#x003b2;-secretase cleavage at the A&#x003b2; (1&#x02013;40/42)-producing &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> site starting with D1, and the E11, &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-site resulting in A&#x003b2; (11&#x02013;40/42). Incubation of the purified recombinant ASP-2 with the APPswe at ph 8.5 also produced cleavage at the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-site as only the 12.39 k band is visible. The 12.4-k band was also labelled by the 6E10 antibody further confirming that it is the result of APPswe cleavage at the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-site. These results reveal that the activity of ASP-2 is influenced by pH which apparently governs the site at which ASP-2 cleaves the APPswe protein.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold><italic>In vitro</italic> cleavage of APPswe by pure recombinant ASP-2; differential cleavage occurs at acidic or alkaline pH</bold><bold>Panel A:</bold> anti-CT15 IgG immunoprecipitated (<sup>35</sup>S)-labelled APPswe (2 &#x003bc;M APPswe) was incubated with either just buffer (lane 1) or with pure ASP-2 at 6 nM (lane 2).

It was therefore important to study the maturation, processing and activity of ASP-2 and relate that to the proteolytic events that lead to A&#x003b2; production. In agreement with several other reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] glycosylated proteins were successfully produced in HEK293 cells displaying mobility of ~55&#x02013;70 and 65&#x02013;80-k, for ASP-1 and ASP-2, respectively. The broadness of these bands suggested a heterogeneous protein population, as a result of variable translational modification which was mainly due to glycosylation and possibly pro-processing and as also detected by others in the fully glycosylated, endoglycosidase H-resistant ASP-2 forms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Using a new anti-ASP-2 IgG, we detected the presence of higher molecular weight proteins in the purified preparations, by analysis under denaturing SDS-PAGE, which corresponded in size to ASP-2 homo-multimers. Oligomerisation has also been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] for pepsin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]and cathepsin E [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. A putative dimer was clearly noted at ~150-k, corresponding to (ASP-2)<sub>2</sub>, which was also sensitive to deglycosylation giving rise to a change in mobility which corresponded to two monomers. The appearance of the largest ASP-2 forms was partly dependent on concentration and length of storage suggesting this is partly due to non-specific aggregation. In contrast, the putative dimers (~140 kDa) were evident even in fresh samples and were mainly insensitive to reducing agent providing evidence for the existence of strong non-disulphide protein-protein interactions not broken by high salt and non-ionic detergents used during purification or the strong denaturing conditions of SDS-boiling used during SDS-PAGE. Recently a laboratory in Germany reported the isolation of native active ASP-2 dimers from human brain homogenates, (Multhaup, G. and colleagues from Germany, unpublished data[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]). These native dimers were similar to those observed in our preparations as they were SDS-resistant.</p><p>Activation of acidic proteases by removal of a pro-peptide occurs either by autocatalysis as in the case of pepsinogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and other aspartic proteases, or the action of other proteases, like Cathepsins S and L which activate Cathepsin C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Several reports by other laboratories, showed furin to successfully cleave the ASP-2 pro-segment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] also demonstrating that recombinant ASP-2 does not cleave its own synthetic or recombinant fusion pro-segments. However, Hussain <italic>et al</italic>. (2001), have recently shown that minimal cleavage of ASP-1 pro-domain is achieved by ASP-2 whereas ASP-1 displayed a unimolecular pro-peptide auto-removal. Here we demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic> cleavage of the ASP-2 pro-peptide in full-length, pure, recombinant proteins instigated by incubation of ASP-2 at acidic pH, implying autocatalysis. We propose that cleavage occurs at two sites RLPLR&#x02193;S<sub>32</sub> and RLPR&#x02193;E<sub>46</sub> within the pro-domain, suggesting a two-step cleavage resembling the mechanism of maturation of other aspartic proteinases by autocatalysis (for a review see Richter <italic>et al</italic>., 1998). We have not investigated to see if the pro-sequence removal from ASP-2 is a unimolecular reaction, or due to the attack of a second ASP-2 molecule. APP cleavage at both the Asp1 (&#x003b2;1-site) as well as the Glu11 (&#x003b2;2-site) positions shows that ASP-2 has a preference to cleave N-terminally to an acidic residue as is the case for the pro-peptide cleavage. However, although the RXXR&#x02193; found in the ASP-2 pro-sequence is thought to be a minimal sequence required for a pro-peptide convertase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] furin prefers to cleave C-terminal to two adjacent basic residues. Recent results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] showed that ASP-2 processing takes place in furin-deficient cell lines and suggested that other pro-peptide convertases are involved whereas Bennett <italic>et al</italic>., 2000 observed that a proportion of recombinant ASP-2 is processed in cells untransfected with furin. Further to those findings we suggest that ASP-2 can remove its pro-domain by autocatalysis <italic>in vitro</italic>, as the BACE inhibitor inhibits this process whereas EDTA does not, so that an additional pro-peptide convertase may not be required. Hence, it is possible that autocatalysis could be preferred under conditions of acidic pH, or in cells or cellular subcompartments where pro-peptide convertases are not expressed. Although other reports have shown that ASP-2 does not cleave its pro-domain <italic>in vitro</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] the difference between those and our observations could be due to differences in the protein preparations. We used full-length pure proteins for enzyme and substrate whereas, synthetic peptides as well as truncated fusion proteins were employed in those studies. These factors in addition to differences in expression systems (and modifications) could influence the results observed herein as encountered for pepsinogen, which displays different activation kinetics as a fusion than as a whole protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. To conclude we suggest that ASP-2 may cleave its pro-peptide in a two-step mechanism in the absence of any other protease. Multiple-step removal of pro-sequences has been seen with other aspartic proteinases, where complete activation sometimes requires cleavage at more than one site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p><p>We showed <italic>in vitro</italic> &#x003b2;-secretase activity of ASP-2, producing a C-terminal APP fragment, Mw 12-kDa, consistent with APPswe cleavage at the &#x003b2;1-site. This cleavage occurs efficiently at ph 8.5 although the optimum pH of ASP-2 activity is acidic. We must mention though that a proportion of ASP-2 in the ph 8.5 preparation is processed (as purified from the cells) and could contribute to the &#x003b2;-cleavage of APP we observe at ph 8.5. Cleavage of APPswe at ph 5, however was different to pH 8.5 as it resulted in two C-terminal APP fragments each corresponding to cleavage at the A&#x003b2;-producing site (&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>), and the &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-site described by Creemers <italic>et al.</italic> (2000), to be the most favourable producing N-terminally truncated, highly cytotoxic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], A&#x003b2; peptides (11&#x02013;42) found in patients with the Flemish mutation. Creemers et al. (2000) suggested that cleavage at these sites is governed by the expression levels of ASP-2, <italic>in vivo</italic>, rather than its maturation. In addition to that we report here that our results show that pH can also determine the site of APPswe &#x003b2;-cleavage by ASP-2. Results from our laboratory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] have localised &#x003b2;-cleavage of APP in the TGN and early endosomes, and recently Huse <italic>et al</italic>. (2000) showed TGN localisation for ASP-2 indicating that these compartments are loci for &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-site cleavage of APP as their pH is acidic. On the other hand, localisation in the endoplasmic reticulum and early Golgi imply processing at neutral to alkaline pH that according to our results gives cleavage at the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-site and production of A&#x003b2; (1&#x02013;40/42).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Taken together, our results of ASP-2 pro-peptide processing and diverse APP proteolysis, both happening at ph 5, imply an additional mode of cellular control of APP &#x003b2;-cleavage whereby subcellular localisation of APP and ASP-2 in different compartments where the pH is either acidic or alkaline influences the proteolytic processing of both ASP-2 as well as of APP by ASP-2 itself and consequently the production of A&#x003b2;. Thus APP cleavage at ph 5 is relevant to Alzheimer's in patients with the Flemish and Dutch mutations who demonstrate increased deposition of N-terminally truncated A&#x003b2;, resulting from APP processing at the &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-site.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Culture media and antibiotics were from Life Technologies, Paisley, UK.
