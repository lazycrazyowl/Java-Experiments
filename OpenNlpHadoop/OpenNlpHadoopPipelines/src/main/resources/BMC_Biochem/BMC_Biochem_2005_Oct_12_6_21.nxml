A key feature of these proteases is a conserved methionine-containing 1,4-tight &#x003b2; turn at the base of the active site zinc binding region.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>To explore the invariant methionine position in this class of protease, incorporation of a nonnatural fluorinated methionine, L-difluoromethionine (DFM), into this site was accomplished. Although overproduction of the N-terminal catalytic fragment of AprA resulted in protein aggregates which could not be resolved, successful heterologous production of the entire AprA was accomplished in the presence and absence of the nonnatural amino acid. DFM incorporation was found to only slightly alter the enzyme kinetics of AprA. In addition, differential scanning calorimetry indicated no significant alteration in the thermal stability of the modified enzyme.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Although invariant in all metzincin proteases, the methionine 214 position in AprA can be successfully replaced by the nonnatural amino acid DFM resulting in little effect on protein structure and function. This study indicates that the increased size of the methyl group by the introduction of two fluorines is still sufficiently non-sterically demanding, and bodes well for the application of DFM to biophysical studies of protein structure and function in this class of protease.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The metzincin superfamily of proteases includes the matrixins, astacins, reprolysins, snapalysins, leishmanolysins and serralysins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. These zinc-dependent endoproteases may act on a large number of substrates, or they may be highly specific, targeting only one or a few proteins or oligopeptides. There are over 700 different enzymes that have been classified as metzincins and they are produced by organisms ranging from bacteria to plants and animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. As diverse as the members of this superfamily are, surprisingly they all share a structurally similar catalytic site which includes a common zinc binding motif and an absolutely conserved methionine-containing 1,4-tight &#x003b2; turn, termed the "Met-turn" in their active sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Many of the metzincin proteases are of medical significance. The matrixins, or matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) include the collagenases, gelatinases and stromelysins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Members of this subfamily not only degrade extracellular matrix for tissue remodeling and maturation, but they have also been found to release and activate several growth factors and modulate chemotactic signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In disease processes, however, they have been implicated in promoting tumour invasion and metastasis by degradation of matrix barriers, exacerbating periodontal disease, and destroying aggrecan and collagen in rheumatoid arthritis. For this reason, much interest has arisen in mechanistic and inhibitor studies of MMPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The astacins comprise a subfamily of enzymes involved in digestion, developmental regulation, and peptide processing. The reprolysins or adamalysins are mainly responsible for the hemorrhagic effects and tissue necrosis typical of snake bites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. These effects are caused mainly by destruction of the extra-cellular matrix surrounding capillaries in conjunction with the inhibition of platelet aggregation by disintegrins. The N-terminal catalytic domains of members of this family are usually zinc and calcium dependent, while the C-terminal portion may be disintegrin, cysteine-rich, or lectin type domains with hemorrhagic or cell adhesion properties. Mammalian adamalysins play important roles in reproduction, myogenesis and cytodifferentiation as well as in disorders such as asthma, cardiac hypertrophy, and endotoxic shock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The snapalysins are secreted proteases from several <italic>Streptomyces </italic>organisms and the membrane-bound leishmanolysins originate from a number of protozoan parasites. The serralysins, of which the alkaline protease from <italic>P. aeruginosa </italic>(AprA) is a member, are secreted by several pathogenic, gram-negative bacterial species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. They are, on average, 50 kDa proteins consisting of 2 domains; the C-terminal domain binds up to eight calcium ions in a mainly structural role, but also contains the secretion signal. The catalytic site is located in a cleft on the N-terminal domain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The physiologic substrate(s) of these enzymes are not known with certainty, but are thought to be proteins of the extracellular matrix and possibly immune response elements such as interferon gamma and complement proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Ribbon representation of alkaline protease from <italic>P. aeruginosa </italic>(AprA).

One aspect of this approach is the incorporation of amino acids containing fluorine which would be applicable to not only probing subtle steric interactions in proteins (Van der Waals' radius of F is 1.47 &#x000c5; vs. 1.20 &#x000c5; for H), but also in applying <sup>19</sup>F spectroscopy to this area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In order to probe the methionine position in this class of proteins (specifically AprA), the fluorinated analogue, S-difluoromethyl-L-homocysteine (L-difluoromethionine, (DFM)), was utilized to replace the methionine in the Met-turn and to determine its effects on catalytic activity and thermal stability.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>N-terminal catalytic fragment</title><p>Attempts to overproduce the N-terminal catalytic fragment of AprA which consisted of residues T40 to N258 of the 479 residue protein led to the production of aggregates in spite of attempts to increase soluble protein expression by control of temperature, isopropyl-&#x003b2;-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) concentration, co-expression of folding chaperones (GroES and GroEL) as well as secretion and fusion to a NusA solubility tag [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In several attempts at resolubilisation of these inclusion bodies (see Methods for details), semi-soluble aggregates of the truncated AprA were detected by gel filtration chromatography (Superose-12) having molecular weights higher than the exclusion limit of the resin (&#x0003e;2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>Da). Due to the difficulty of isolating and handling sufficient quantities of this truncated version of AprA, attention was then focused on overproduction of the full-length mature form of AprA which corresponds to residues G10 to V479.</p></sec><sec><title>Mature full-length AprA and DFM incorporation</title><p>The gene for the full-length mature form of AprA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] which corresponds to residues G10 to V479 was isolated on to pET22b and overexpressed in <italic>E. coli </italic>BL21 (&#x003bb;DE3), resulting in inclusion body formation. Isolation of the protein aggregates followed by solubilisation and refolding produced an active, stable and soluble enzyme of 49 500 Da, according to mass spectrometric analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). L-DFM was synthesized as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and incorporated into AprA using the methionine auxotrophic <italic>E. coli </italic>strain, B834 (&#x003bb;DE3). The resulting inclusion bodies were refolded in an identical manner as the non-labelled protein, and the expected 49 535 Da protein, as determined by electrospray mass spectrometry (ESMS), was isolated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>SDS-PAGE gel summary of the refolding of mature full-length AprA.

It appears that a combination of AprA, elastase (LasB) and LasA protease and protease IV work in concert to produce tissue invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. AprA is biosynthesized in <italic>P. aeruginosa </italic>as a 479 residue polypeptide which is secreted via a C-terminal signal sequence directly into the extra cellular medium where a 9 amino acid N-terminal inhibitory propeptide is autocatalytically removed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. A critical aspect to the structure-function of AprA and the metzincins in general is the active-site arrangement of the metal ligands and the still incompletely understood methionine-containing 1,4-tight &#x003b2; turn at the base of the active site present in all members of the metzincin superfamily. Although much is known concerning the cellular biochemistry of a number of metzincins, detailed knowledge of the function of the components of the active site is still lacking. For example, methionine residues in proteins are less frequent in occurrence than many other residues (third least abundant after tryptophan and cysteine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]) and it can frequently be replaced with other hydrophobic amino acids such as leucine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. However the surprising persistent presence of methionine in over 700 members of this class of protease has been noted[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Attempts to define the contribution that this seemingly quintessential amino acid plays in this class of enzyme have indicated that, depending upon the specific superfamily member studied, some flexibility in replacement may be possible, at least <italic>in vitro</italic>. For example, in the case of MMP-2 (gelatinase A), enzymes with replacements of the active site Met with either Leu or Ser have only minor perturbations in catalytic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. In the case of protease C from <italic>Erwinia chrysanthemi</italic>, replacement of the active site methionine (Met226) by leucine, alanine or isoleucine resulted in enzyme mutants sufficiently stable to be isolated, but this was not so with M226H, M226S or M226N mutations. However the enzyme kinetic properties of the M226L, M226A and M226I mutants were compromised and crystallographic studies indicated some alteration of the zinc binding histidines which might explain the effects of these mutations on the kinetic properties of the enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>Substitution of the active site Met by selenomethionine (SeMet) in MMP-8 (human neutrophil collagenase) was also found to be somewhat perturbing. In the catalytic domain of MMP-8, SeMet appeared to decrease the protein's resistance to urea denaturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. This loss of stability was accompanied by a considerable decrease in activity and an increase in K<sub>m </sub>towards the substrate (7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetyl-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-(3- [2,4-dinitrophenyl]-L- 2,3-diaminopropionyl)-Ala-Arg-NH<sub>2</sub>. In a previous study using the substrate (dinitrophenyl-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-Trp-Ala-D-Arg-NH<sub>2</sub>), however, k<sub>cat </sub>and K<sub>m </sub>values were unaffected by SeMet replacement in MMP-8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>Evidently additional investigations into the properties of the metzincins through modification of the methionine position may be of importance. However the usual ensemble of potential replacements of amino acid residues through site-directed mutagenesis is limited in general to replacement with the other nineteen amino acids. In order to explore the effects of alterations of the critical methionine in the metzincin class of proteases, the introduction of a sterically and electronically subtle methionine analogue DFM, was the focus of the present study. For these studies the alkaline protease from <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </italic>was initially investigated as it is representative of the metzincin family of proteases, is important in tissue invasion by this pathogen and has only two methionines in its structure, the N-terminal methionine and the Met-turn methionine, M214. The presence of only two methionine residues in this metzincin (and only the active site methionine if a mature secreted AprA is produced) facilitates bioincorporation of DFM into the protein without the use of complex cell free in-vitro translation system approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. As well, this choice of target protein for a preliminary study avoids complications with additional bioincorporation of the analogue into other methionine positions which may be present in other members of the metzincin superfamily.</p><p>DFM is a subtle derivative of methionine that has been shown to be useful as a <sup>19</sup>F-NMR probe in proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Unlike leucine and isoleucine, this unbranched analogue may only produce a moderate increase in the steric properties of the methyl group due to the incorporation of two fluorine atoms. In addition, fluorination could profoundly affect the electron density of the sulfur atom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. As can be seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, the thiomethyl group of M214 is in close proximity to H176, H180, and H186 and may contribute to the proper positioning of these metal ligands. Hence it was of interest to explore the effects of this nonnatural amino acid on the catalytic activity and thermal stability of the modified protein by introduction of L-difluoromethionine into the critical methionine position in the Met-turn.</p><p>Previous studies on other metzincins such as stromelysin, MMP-8, and astacin have shown that the truncated enzymes containing only the catalytic domain of these enzymes could be expressed and were sufficiently stable to be studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. In the current study, initial attempts were therefore focused on the overproduction of the smaller N-terminal catalytic domain of AprA (T40 to N258). Although evidence for cellular production of this fragment was observed, almost complete aggregation of this fragment occurred under a variety of experimental conditions designed for its control (Results). Previous reports by Guzzo and co-workers have shown that even minimal recombinant expression (1 &#x003bc;g/mL) of soluble, intact AprA protein required the co-expression of the entire secretion apparatus (AprD, AprE, AprF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. When the structural gene for AprA was expressed alone, however, intracellular accumulation of AprA was barely detectable, most likely due to rapid degradation inside the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. In other reports, significant quantities of the enzyme could be found intracellularly, but only in the form of inclusion bodies, which are known to be highly resistant to degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>].</p><p>However successful production of mature full length (G10 to V479) AprA, was accomplished without the co-expression of the entire secretion apparatus. Although insoluble protein aggregates were produced, it was possible to resolubilise and refold the overexpressed protein, yielding approximately 40 mg of high purity enzyme per 1 L of culture (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The ESMS analysis revealed that although the majority of the protein isolated from this protocol had M<sub>r </sub>= 49 500 Da (full length mature AprA, G10-V479), a small quantity of inseparable enzyme with an M<sub>r </sub>= 49 632 Da had maintained its N-terminal methionine (Met-G10-V479) from the cloning procedure (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Kinetic analysis of this recombinant mature AprA compared favourably with values previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] for the wild type AprA secreted by <italic>P. aeruginosa </italic>(k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m </sub>of 2140 &#x000b1; 540 M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1 </sup>and 1800 &#x000b1; 300 M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1 </sup>for wild type and recombinant enzymes respectively).</p><p>An almost 100% incorporation level of the fluorinated probe into AprA was readily accomplished by induction of protein expression in minimal media supplemented with 2 mM DFM. The labelled protein was also expressed as intracellular inclusion bodies which were resolubilised and refolded using the same protocol as the unlabelled recombinant protein, yielding approximately 16 mg of nearly homogeneous protein per 1 L of culture (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The ESMS analysis indicated that, unlike the unlabelled recombinant AprA, a majority of the DFM incorporated protein maintained the initiating residue (Mr = 49 702 Da), while this DFM was cleaved in only about one quarter of the sample (Mr = 49 535 Da) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The interesting observation that removal of the N-terminal DFM residue occurs to a lesser extent compared to methionine in this position indicates that the processing of fluorinated methionines by methionine aminopeptidase is a less efficient process. Related to this observation is a recent report by Budisa and coworkers indicating the lack of removal of trifluoromethionine from the N-terminus of a mutant green fluorescent protein[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. It may be that the increased steric size of the fluorinated methyl groups in these analogues alters the correct positioning of the peptide bond of the substrate in the active site of the methionine aminopeptidase which could reduce hydrolytic efficiency by this enzyme. In any event, the presence of the N-terminal methionine (or DFM) is not expected to affect catalytic activity or thermal stability of the protein as the N-terminus is physically remote from the active site. The kinetic characteristics of the protein mixture with and without incorporated DFM were determined under the revised conditions described in the methods and results sections. The K<sub>m </sub>was not significantly altered by replacement with DFM, the V<sub>max </sub>and therefore k<sub>cat </sub>were only slightly impaired, resulting in a decrease in k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m </sub>from 620 &#x000b1; 30 M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1 </sup>to 530 &#x000b1; 50 M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>.</p><p>In order to compare the effects of DFM on thermal stability of the protein, preliminary differential scanning calorimetry studies were undertaken on AprA and DFM-AprA. Under the conditions utilized in these experiments, the thermal denaturations of AprA and DFM-AprA were found to be irreversible. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, the thermal stability in 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.8) was not significantly altered upon fluorination of the Met-turn methionine. The T<sub>max </sub>for unlabelled and DFM-labelled AprA were determined to be 58.7 &#x000b1; 0.1&#x000b0;C and 58.6 &#x000b1; 0.2&#x000b0;C respectively. This would indicate that the introduction of two fluorine atoms into the methyl group, which is in close contact to the critical histidines in the active site, can be accommodated by the protein such that the catalytic properties and thermal stability of AprA are not drastically perturbed.</p><p>Due to the lack of background <sup>19</sup>F resonances in most biological systems, the 100% natural abundance of the <sup>19</sup>F isotope and its sensitivity to NMR detection of 83 % to that of <sup>1</sup>H, the application of <sup>19</sup>F spectroscopy to studies in protein structure and function has been an important biophysical technique that has been shown to give critical information on the environment surrounding the fluorine nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Previous studies on DFM incorporation into the transglycosylase of bacteriophage &#x003bb; and the leucine-isoleucine-valine (LIV) binding protein from <italic>E. coli</italic>, have detected separate sets of resonances for each DFM residue present in each protein and their presence has been useful in detection of ligand binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. As the two fluorine atoms in DFM are diastereotopic due to the presence of the chiral centre of the &#x003b1;-carbon of methionine, complex <sup>19</sup>F resonances can result. In fact, it has been shown that a complex octet of <sup>19</sup>F resonances is observed when a DFM residue is located in a conformationally restricted protein environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. It was therefore of interest to investigate the <sup>19</sup>F NMR spectroscopy of DFM-AprA. The <sup>1</sup>H-coupled <sup>19</sup>F NMR spectrum of DFM-AprA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>) is a composite of the <sup>19</sup>F resonances not only from the active site DFM at position 214, but also a contribution from the presence of protein molecules still maintaining the N-terminal DFM residue. Interestingly the two resonances overlap in the 564 MHz spectrum. It has previously been shown that application of paramagnetic line broadening agents, such as Gd(EDTA)<sup>- </sup>will broaden the <sup>19</sup>F NMR resonances from fluorine nuclei in a protein in a distance-dependent manner and can serve to indicate which <sup>19</sup>F resonances originate from more solution exposed residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. To possibly distinguish the signal contributions from each DFM, paramagnetic line broadening experiments utilizing Gd(EDTA)<sup>- </sup>were undertaken. These experiments (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>) indicated that both DFM residues (DFM1 and DFM214) were equally susceptible to the line-broadening agent, indicating that close approach to the active site DFM by Gd(EDTA)<sup>- </sup>was also possible in solution. Based on the crystal structure of AprA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>], the active site is open to solvent and could be expected to reasonably accommodate the rather large Gd(EDTA)<sup>- </sup>molecule resulting in little discrimination between the two DFM residues. Although proton decoupling simplified the <sup>19</sup>F spectrum (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>), the resonances from the two DFM residues were still unresolved; the complexity of which may also result from contributions of the restricted environment of the active site DFM. Attempts to remove the N-terminal DFM with recombinant <italic>E. coli </italic>methionine aminopeptidase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>] under a variety of conditions resulted in complex mixtures due to proteolytic degradation by AprA. Additional attempts to produce a variant of AprA lacking the N-terminal DFM residue by introduction of the wild-type N-terminal self-cleaving propeptide sequence or a thrombin cleavage site resulted in extremely poor isolated yields of these forms of the protease. Further studies will be focused on the application of this NMR probe to investigating conformational changes in the active site upon ligand and inhibitor binding.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The <sup>19</sup>F biophysical probe, DFM, was successfully incorporated into the critical Met-turn of AprA and resulted in minimal catalytic or structural alteration of the enzyme. These findings are encouraging for the further application of DFM as a subtle probe for the investigation of the metzincin family of proteases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Restriction endonucleases were purchased from New England BioLabs (Pickering, ON).
