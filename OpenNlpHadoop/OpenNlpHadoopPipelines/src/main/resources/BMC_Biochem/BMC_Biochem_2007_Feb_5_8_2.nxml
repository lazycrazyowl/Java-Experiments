The best known 17&#x003b2;-HSD is type 3 17&#x003b2;-HSD (17&#x003b2;-HSD3) that is expressed in the testis where it transforms androstenedione (4-dione) into testosterone (T). Its deficiency is the cause of the well known male pseudohermaphroditism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. This enzyme is inactive for C18-steroids. An additional enzyme able to catalyze the transformation of 4-dione into T is type 5 17&#x003b2;-HSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Since 17&#x003b2;-HSD3 is not expressed in the ovary while 17&#x003b2;-HSD5 is present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and women deficient in 17&#x003b2;-HSD3 are asymptomatic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], it is likely that 17&#x003b2;-HSD5 is the enzyme responsible for the formation of active androgens in the human ovary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand, the most studied 17&#x003b2;-HSD is type 1 17&#x003b2;-HSD, probably because it is expressed abundantly in the placenta. In fact, 17&#x003b2;-HSD1 was the first 17&#x003b2;-HSD to be purified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], cloned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and crystallized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In intact cell in culture, the enzyme catalyzes almost exclusively the transformation of estrone (El) into estradiol (E2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The abundant co-expression of this estrogenic 17&#x003b2;-HSD as well as aromatase in the placenta suggests that the aromatization step precedes the 17&#x003b2;-HSDs step. This proposed mechanism is also in agreement with a higher affinity of aromatase for 4-dione than for testosterone. Other 17&#x003b2;-HSDs are known to be able to metabolize estrogens. Thus types 7 and 12 17&#x003b2;-HSDs catalyze the formation of E2, types 2, 4, and 8 17&#x003b2;-HSDs that preferred NAD<sup>+ </sup>as cofactor are E2 inactivating enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Up to now, at least twelve isoforms of 17&#x003b2;-HSDs have been identified and some members of the 17&#x003b2;-HSDs family have been shown multifunctionality associated with cancer, metabolism diseases and neurodegenerative disorders, in addition to their roles in steroid metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Most of 17&#x003b2;-HSDs belong to the short-chain dehydrogenase reductase (SDR) superfamily except the type 5 17&#x003b2;-HSD, which belongs to the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily. A particular property of members of 17&#x003b2;-HSDs family is that they possess very different primary structures (an average of only approximately 20% amino acid identity) despite being highly specific for substrates having closely related structures. Additional regulation of 17&#x003b2;-HSDs activity is achieved by the specificity of tissue distribution of these 17&#x003b2;-HSDs, thus permitting each tissue to control intracellular steroid levels according to local needs. Such local intracellular formation of steroids in peripheral target tissues from the adrenal precursor dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) has been called intracrinology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Recently, we have found that the h17&#x003b2;-HSD12, a homolog of type 3 17&#x003b2;-HSD, selectively catalyzes the formation of E2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. To gain more knowledge about this potentially very important enzyme, we have isolated a corresponding enzyme in the cynomolgus monkey (<italic>Macaca fascicularis</italic>), and characterized its substrate specificity, mRNA tissue distribution and cellular localization.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Sequence of Maraca fascicularis 17&#x003b2;-HSD12</title><p>We have isolated a coding sequence of <italic>Macaca fascicularis </italic>17&#x003b2;-HSD12 (GenBank accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AB169576">AB169576</ext-link>) using <italic>Macaca fascicularis </italic>liver mRNA and PCR amplification.

The present data strongly suggest that 17&#x003b2;-HSD12 is most likely the key enzyme controlling the local conversion of El (low estrogenic activity) into E2 (the most potent natural estrogen). It is noteworthy that El could come from both sources, the local transformation of the precursor 4-dione by aromatase or from the circulation under the form of El and El-S [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. It is well recognized that most of peripheral cells possess all the necessary enzymatic machinery to transform the adrenal androgen precursors into E2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Cells that possess steroid sulfatase could use the sulfated precursor DHEA-S and El-S to produce E2.</p><p>The mRNA tissue distribution analysis performed with quantitative RealTime PCR shows that the enzyme is distributed ubiquitously, thus suggesting its important role in the production of estradiol in a large number and possibly all peripheral target tissues. In contrast 17&#x003b2;-HSD1 is more selectively expressed in the placenta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and in granulosa cells of the ovary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The highest mRNA expression levels have been found in the cerebellum and spleen suggesting that this enzyme could play an important role in these tissues. However, in the tissues where a lower mRNA expression levels is observed, it could not mean that the role exerted by the enzyme is not important, but it reflects essentially the relatively fewer amount of cells expressing this enzyme compare to the total cells in the tissue.</p><p>Cloning of the cDNA of <italic>mf</italic>17&#x003b2;-HSD12 has allowed us to study the cellular localization of the enzyme in the mammary gland and uterus. In the mammary gland, 17&#x003b2;-HSD12 mRNA expression was detected in both epithelial and stromal cells. This is in agreement with the action of estrogens in the development and proliferation of alveoli and lactogenesis in the mammary gland. In the uterus, the enzyme was found in the both epithelial cells and stromal cells of the endometrium. These results strongly suggest that 17&#x003b2;-HSD12 is directly involved in the local synthesis of E2 in the estrogen target tissues.</p><p>Although twelve types of 17&#x003b2;-HSDs have been identified based on their specificity to catalyze the interconversion of the 17&#x003b2;-ketosteroids and 17&#x003b2;-hydroxysteroids, and named according to the chronological order of their characterization, the true physiological role of many of these enzymes remains to be determined. For example, the phenotype of Hsdl7b2 knockout mice is not well explained by the known activities of 17&#x003b2;-HSD2 on sex steroids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. On the other hand, 17&#x003b2;-HSD4, which was originally identified as the estradiol-inactiving dehydrogenasse from porcine endometrium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], mainly participates in the &#x003b2;-oxidation of fatty acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Accordingly, mutations of the 17&#x003b2;-HSD4 gene lead to severe developmental defects resembling Zellweger syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], a rare hereditary disorder affecting infants, and usually results in death associated with unusual problems in prenatal development, an enlarged liver, high levels of iron and copper in the blood, and vision disturbances. Type 6 17&#x003b2;-HSD, an enzyme observed in the rat, most probably corresponds to type 9 17&#x003b2;-HSD in the mouse that catalyses the transformation of 5&#x003b1;-androstane-3&#x003b1;, 17&#x003b2;-diol (3&#x003b1;-diol) into androsterone (ADT). The corresponding human ortholog is not yet identified. On the other hand, type 7 17&#x003b2;-HSD is presently best characterized as a 3&#x003b2;-reductase involved in cholesterol metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], and the role of type 8 17&#x003b2;-HSD as an estradiol inactivating enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] is still not well defined. Types 10 and 11 l7&#x003b2;-HSDs metabolize 5&#x003b1;-reduced steroids but their involvement in the metabolism of active steroids is unclear. Type 12 17&#x003b2;-HSD was identified as 3-ketoacyl-CoA reductase, involved in long chain fatty acid elongation with a very weak activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Recently, we have found that the H17&#x003b2;-HSD12 catalyzes selectively the formation of E2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Overall, among the twelve enzymes identified as l7&#x003b2;-HSDs, only four are most likely working as l7&#x003b2;-HSDs synthesizing active steroids: the types 3 and 5 l7&#x003b2;-HSDs are involved in the transformation of C19-steroids (4-dione into T) while types 1 and 12 are involved in the conversion of El into E2. The selective activity of type 12 17&#x003b2;-HSD for the transformation of El into E2 in the <italic>Macaca fascicularis </italic>(this report) as well as the high mRNA expression levels of this enzyme in estrogen-sensitive tissues, including the mammary gland and uterus, strongly suggest that this enzyme is a crucial partner of aromatase in the biosynthesis of estradiol. Indeed, the presence of estrogen specific 17&#x003b2;-HSDs (types 1, 7 and 12 l7&#x003b2;-HSDs) catalyzing the transformation of El to E2 and the higher affinity of aromatase for 4-dione than for T are strongly in favor of the pathway in which 4-dione is converted into El by aromatase followed by the transformation of El into E2 by estrogen specific l7&#x003b2;-HSDs. This pathway is in contrast with a generally believed pathway in which 4-dione is transformed to T by l7&#x003b2;-HSDs followed by the aromatization of T into E2. It strongly suggests that in the estradiol biosynthesis pathway, the step of 17-ketoreduction comes after the step of the aromatization (the aromatization of 4-androstendione to estrone followed by the conversion of estrone into estradiol by estrogen specific l7&#x003b2;-HSDs). The higher affinity of aromatase for 4-androstenedione than for testosterone seems to agree with the present data.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These results strongly suggest that the <italic>Macaca fascicularis </italic>17&#x003b2;-HSD12 is an essential partner of aromatase in the biosynthesis of estradiol (E2).

The tissues used were harvested from euthanized normal female and male cynomolgus monkeys, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70&#x000b0;C until analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from the <italic>Macaca fascicularis </italic>adrenal gland, ovary, mammary gland, endometrium, myometrium, cerebral cortex, cerebellum, liver, pancreas, heart, testis, prostate, kidney, skin, muscle and spleen by using Tri-Reagent RNA/DNA/Protein Isolation Reagent (Molecular Research Center Inc., Cincinnati, OH, USA). The extraction was performed according to the manufacturer's directions. Quantification was made by optical density at 260 nm. 5.0 &#x003bc;g of total RNA was converted to cDNA by incubation at 42&#x000b0;C for 1 h with 200 U of Superscript II RNase H-RT (Invitrogen, Burlington, Ont. Canada), 300 ng of oligo-dT18, 500 &#x003bc;M deoxynucleotide triphosphate, 10 mM dithiothreitol, and 34 U of porcine RNase inhibitor (Amersham Pharmacia) in a final volume of 50 &#x003bc;l. The resulting products were then treated with RNase A for 30 min at 37&#x000b0;C and purified thereafter with Qiaquick PCR purification kit (QIAGEN, Mississauga, Ontario).</p></sec><sec><title>Isolation of Macaca fascicularis 17&#x003b2;-HSD12 cDNA</title><p>Since ortholog genes between the human and monkey possess generally more than 90&#x02013;95% identity, we designed oligonucleotide primers based on the human sequence before the initiation codon (forward primer 5'-GTA-GTG-AGG-CCT-AGT-GGA-AAG-CCA-TG-3') and after stop codon (reverse primer 5'-CAA-GTT-ACA-ATG-CAG-TTA-TCA-TGC-3'). The fragment containing the entire <italic>mf </italic>17&#x003b2;-HSD12 open reading frame was obtained by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) amplification from <italic>Macaca fascucularis </italic>liver mRNA. The resulting PCR product was directly subcloned into a Zero Blunt TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Burlington, Ont. Canada). Plasmid DNA was prepared using the Qiagen Mega kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's protocol. The integrity of the construct was verified by automated dideoxynucleotide DNA sequencing using the Big Dye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing (ABI Prism, applied biosystem, Forster city, CA). The cDNA fragment was further transferred into PCMVneo expression vector in order to prepare stable transfected HEK-293 cells for activity characterization.</p></sec><sec><title>Enzymatic activity was determined in intact HEK-293 cells stably expressing Macaca fascicularis 17&#x003b2;-HSD12</title><p>Stable expression of <italic>mf</italic>17&#x003b2;-HSD12 in transformed human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293) was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].

The steroids were dissolved in 50 &#x003bc;L of dichloromethane, applied to Silica gel 60 thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), before separation by migration in the toluene/acetone (4:1) solvent system. Substrates and metabolites were identified by comparison with reference steroids, revealed by autoradiography and quantified using the Phospholmager System (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA).</p></sec><sec><title>mRNA expression by Quantitative RealTime PCR (Q_RTPCR)</title><p><italic>Macaca fascicularis </italic>17&#x003b2;-HSD12 was amplified using the gene-specific primers: 5'-CAG-GCT-TGG-CTG-GTC-TTG-AA-3' and 5'-CAC-CAT-GCC-AGG-CAG-TAC-CAA-3'. cDNA corresponding to 30 ng of the initial total RNA was used to perform fluorescent-based RealTime PCR quantification using the LightCycler RealTime PCR apparatus (Hoffman-La Roche Inc. Nutley, NJ) as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The conditions for the PCR reactions were: denaturation at 94&#x000b0;C for 15 sec, annealing at 50&#x000b0;C for 10 sec and elongation at 72&#x000b0;C for 35 sec.
