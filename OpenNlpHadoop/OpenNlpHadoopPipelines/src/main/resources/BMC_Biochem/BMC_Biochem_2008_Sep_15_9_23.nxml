In the cytoplasm, YB-1 participates in the formation of mRNPs and in the regulation of mRNA translation and degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In the nucleus, YB-1 functions as a Y-box binding transcription factor, where it activates transcription of various cellular genes, including those implicated in cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]). Translocation of YB-1 from cytoplasm to the cell nucleus can occur at certain steps of the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and in response to stress-induced DNA damages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The association of YB-1 with nucleic acids causes global changes in their structures by melting short or imperfect duplexes and acceleration of annealing and strand exchange reactions between complementary strands of RNA and DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. YB-1 may thus participate in DNA recombination and replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and in the case of damaged DNA, YB-1 may assist in its reparation.</p><p>Molecular and structural investigations showed that YB-1 interacts with RNA and DNA through two non-homologous domains: the cold-shock domain (CSD), which consists of five anti-parallel beta-strands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and the C-terminal domain, which contains a series of alternating clusters of positively and negatively charged amino acid residues.</p><p>In addition to its interaction with nucleic acids, YB-1 interplays with different protein partners within the cell. It has been noticed that the interaction of YB-1 with p53 increases the affinity of p53 for DNA promoters that could stimulate transcription of p53-controled genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Similarly, YB-1 interacts with the T-antigen of polyomavirus JC and triggers transcription of viral genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. YB-1 can also catalyze splicing of pre-mRNA via interaction with RNA polymerase II, EWS (Ewing's sarcoma protein) and TLS (translocation liposarcoma protein) proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>The objective of the present work was to identify new YB-1 protein partners to better understand the functions of this protein. We discovered, using a series of biochemical <italic>in vitro </italic>experiments, that YB-1 strongly interacts with tubulin, both soluble and polymerized into microtubules. We demonstrated that YB-1 stimulates microtubule assembly, and in addition, that tubulin competes with mRNA for interaction with YB-1. In light of these results, we propose that YB-1 may contribute to coordination of regulation of mRNA translation and dynamics of microtubule cytoskeleton. Tubulin, via its interaction with YB-1, may indirectly influence the translational regulation of mRNP complexes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Tubulin is a new YB-1 interacting protein</title><p>A search for new YB-1 partners from different rabbit tissue extracts was performed by affinity chromatography using YB-1-Sepharose as bait. Though eluates varied in protein composition, two prominent bands migrating as 45 kDa and 50 kDa were detected in the eluates of most of the tissues (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, right panel, marked with an asterisk and a dot, respectively). The 45 kDa protein was identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry as actin, a well-characterized YB-1 partner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and the 50 kDa band was identified by similar means as tubulin (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). The presence of tubulin in extract and eluate fractions was also confirmed by Western blotting using anti-alpha and anti-beta tubulin antibodies. As shown on Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; tubulin subunits were detected in all tissue extracts and high salt eluates. It is interesting to note that, in the case of brain and testis, some tubulin remained in the flow-through fraction. This could be either due to the saturation of the affinity column or linked to the sequestration of tubulin with partner proteins. In the control experiments performed with BSA-Sepharose, all tissue proteins were collected in the flow-through fractions and were undetectable in high salt eluates (data not shown). These results strongly suggested that tubulin binds specifically to YB-1.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>YB-1 affinity chromatography of rabbit tissue extracts</bold>. A, Rabbit tissue extracts (50 &#x003bc;g of total protein) were loaded onto YB-1-Sepharose. After washing with buffer containing 100 mM KCl, bound proteins were eluted with buffer containing 1 M KCl. Extracts and eluates were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie blue staining. Two prominent bands migrating as 45 kDa and 50 kDa were detected in the eluates of most of the tissues (marked with an asterisk and a dot) and were identified by mass spectrometry as actin and tubulin respectively.

Tubulin was totally adsorbed on the YB-1-Sepharose column in the presence of 150 mM NaCl, while poorly retained in similar conditions by a casein-Sepharose control column (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Tubulin started to elute from the YB-1 column at 300 mM NaCl forming a peak around 600 mM NaCl (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). These results indicate that the YB-1:tubulin interaction is not inhibited at physiological and moderate ionic strength (up to 300 mM NaCl). We finally probed the presence of YB-1 and of &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; tubulin subunits in YB-1-tubulin complexes by cross-linking using the zero length cross-linker EDC/Sulfo NHS. As displayed on Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, cross-linker stabilized dimeric forms of YB-1 and &#x003b1; &#x003b2;-tubulin heterodimers, as well as higher molecular weight aggregates (compare lanes 3 and 4 with 1 and 2). It is worthy to note that under these conditions, both YB-1 and tubulin cross-linked samples still contained non-cross-linked products (lanes 3 and 4). When the cross-linking reaction was performed in the presence of both proteins at a YB-1-tubulin molar ratio of 0.5, most YB-1 was found in high-molecular weight complexes containing also both tubulin subunits (compare lanes 1 and 5). An increase of the YB-1:tubulin molar ratio over 0.5 increased the yield of these high molecular weight complexes (lanes 6 to 8) with a slight increase of the free YB-1 band. Our results demonstrate that YB-1 interacts directly with tubulin and suggest that YB-1 contacts the both tubulin subunits in solution.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>YB-1 interacts directly with pure tubulin</bold>.

YB-1 appeared as discrete particles on the mica surface with an average height of 0.7 nm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, upper panel). This value appeared lower than that reported by Skabkin et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] (about 4 nm for monomeric YB-1 in solution of high ionic strength) and probably resulted from YB-1 flattening on the mica surface. Tubulin appeared as particles with an average height of 3.7 nm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, middle panel) in agreement with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In the YB-1-tubulin sample, in contrast to isolated proteins, particles were less homogenous with a size distribution ranging from about 3 to 8 nm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, bottom panel). A novel class of particles was clearly distinguishable, centered around 7 nm. It was attributed to the YB-1-tubulin complexes probably made of several molecules of both tubulin and YB-1.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>AFM images of YB-1, tubulin and YB-1-tubulin complexes</bold>. Isolated YB-1 and tubulin form discrete particles of 0.7 and 3.7 nm heights, respectively. YB-1-tubulin complex samples formed at a 1:1 molar ratio show the presence of an additional population of particles with a height of about 7.9 nm. Histograms illustrating the height distribution of particles are displayed on right panels.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2091-9-23-4"/></fig></sec><sec><title>YB-1 strongly favors tubulin assembly <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>The influence of YB-1 on <italic>in vitro </italic>microtubule assembly was first assessed by turbidimetry. Compared to tubulin control, YB-1 induced a dramatic shortening of the lag-time in a dose dependant manner. It also dose-dependently increased both the apparent rate of microtubule assembly and the steady state plateau value (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). We next examined the distribution of YB-1 in the soluble tubulin or microtubule fractions in steady-state samples using microtubule sedimentation assay. In agreement with turbidimetry data, the presence of YB-1 strongly increased the total amount of tubulin in the pellet (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). In the presence of 5 &#x003bc;M YB-1 and 20 &#x003bc;M tubulin, most of YB-1 was associated with microtubules at steady state. In these conditions, a visual estimation on Coomassie stained gels of the YB-1:tubulin stoichiometry indicated a ratio of about 1 mole of YB-1 per 3 moles of tubulin heterodimer in the pellet. When 20 &#x003bc;M tubulin was assembled in the presence of 10 &#x003bc;M YB-1, we noted a further increase of the amount of tubulin in the pellet. YB-1 was again found mainly in the pellet with however a small amount remaining in the supernatant. In these conditions, the YB-1-tubulin stoichiometry in the pellet rose to about 1 mole of YB-1 per 2 moles of tubulin heterodimer. It is worthy to note that YB-1 alone, when centrifuged in the same conditions remained totally in the supernatant fraction (<italic>data not shown</italic>).</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>YB-1 promotes microtubule assembly and co-sediments with microtubule pellets</bold>.

MAPs favor the nucleation of microtubules, increase the rate of assembly, extent of polymerization and stabilize microtubules against disassembly. To investigate whether YB-1 may also influence tubulin polymerization in conditions close to cellular, we performed a series of experiments with MAPs-tubulin. This preparation contained approximately 15% of MAPs (w/w) as estimated by Coomassie staining of proteins separated on SDS-PAGE. The addition of YB-1 to MAPs-tubulin at a total YB-1-tubulin ratio of 0.3 decreased the lag-time similarly to pure tubulin, increased the rate of polymerization and slightly increased the final microtubule mass as estimated from the steady state plateau value (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Higher amounts of YB-1 further reduced the lag-time of polymerization but did not change significantly the mass of polymerized tubulin. These data indicate that the presence of MAPs does not abrogate the positive effect of YB-1 on the overall kinetics of microtubule assembly.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>YB-1 favors MAPs-tubulin assembly</bold>.

On the other hand, YB-1 is highly positively charged at neutral pH, so it was reasonable to think that YB-1 accelerates microtubule assembly via interaction with tubulin C-termini. It was therefore critical to investigate whether the effects of YB-1 on microtubule assembly could result only from a charge effect or could also be partly due to more specific molecular recognition mechanisms between YB-1 and tubulin. For this purpose, we treated tubulin with subtilisin in such conditions as to cleave the charged C-termini of the both tubulin subunits and investigated the effect of YB-1 on the assembly of the cleaved tubulin product (tubulin S, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). We observed that YB-1 was still able to promote the assembly of tubulin S (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). A strong stimulation of assembly was observed when YB-1 was added at a total YB-1-tubulin S molar ratio as low as 0.13. At this ratio, YB-1 significantly decreased the lag-time and increased the velocity of the polymerization (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>, curve b). Higher concentrations of YB-1 further reduced the lag-time and increased the rate of tubulin S assembly but did not produce any significant additional effect on microtubule mass at steady-state (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>, curves c and d). Together, these data suggest that the promotion of microtubule assembly by YB-1 involves interaction between specific sites of the partners, although non-specific electrostatic interactions may also play an important role.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>YB-1 favors tubulin S assembly</bold>.

Under control conditions, i.e., without YB-1, in AFM images microtubules appeared as straight rods with an apparent height of 10 nm. This indicates that they were flattened on the surface due to the drying procedure (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, upper panel) and the height measurement thus corresponded to two tubulin layers in close contact (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, upper schema). Microtubules formed in the presence of YB-1 were significantly higher than the control ones with an average height of about 17 nm. The increase in height could correspond to YB-1 coating of the microtubule outer wall (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, bottom panel and schema). However, such morphology can also result from microtubules with double walls or with a higher number of protofilaments.</p><fig position="float" id="F8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p><bold>AFM images of microtubules assembled with or without YB-1</bold>.

In control conditions, TEM analyses showed regular microtubules with a diameter of about 25 nm. With YB-1, the ultrastructure of microtubules remained normal with a single layer of tubulin forming their wall and an outer diameter comparable to control (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, compare D' with C'). In addition to this, the number of protofilaments was not significantly different from that of control (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). This supported further the suggestion that YB-1 coats the outer surface of the microtubule. It is also worth noting that, under control conditions, microtubules could often be found in close contact with each other (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9A, C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9C'</xref>), whereas in the presence of YB-1, microtubules appeared regularly distributed and spaced from each other (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9B, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9D'</xref>). Due to its coating the microtubule surface, YB-1 could induce a change in rigidity of microtubule or steric hindrance on its outer surface, which may lead to a larger inter-microtubule spacing.</p><fig position="float" id="F9"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p><bold>YB-1 induces the formation of single wall microtubules</bold>.

In this context, it is necessary to explore whether tubulin can interfere with formation of RNP and induce some modifications of RNP structure. Since RNP differs from naked RNA in net charge and molecular weight, we decided to investigate the effect of tubulin on YB-1-RNA complexes by electrophoretic mobility gel-shift assay. It is known that RNP saturated with YB-1 contains about one molecule of YB-1 per 25 RNA bases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Compared to RNA alone, these saturated YB-1:RNA complexes demonstrate a significant reduction of mobility in native agarose gel due to either partial RNA discharging or the increased mass of the formed YB-1:RNA complex, or both (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>, compare lane 1 and 3). The presence of tubulin did not change mobility of RNA that excluded the possibility of direct interaction between these two molecules (compare lanes 1 and 2). The addition of tubulin to YB-1:RNA complexes clearly increased the mobility of RNP (compare lane 3 with 4 and 5). The presence of tubulin may thus induce structural changes of RNP complexes and/or a change in the RNP charge via YB-1 withdrawal mediated by tubulin. Further investigations are required for a better description of the interaction between mRNA:YB-1 complexes and tubulin, which may play an important role in transition of mRNA from silenced to translationally active state.</p><fig position="float" id="F10"><label>Figure 10</label><caption><p><bold>Tubulin modifies the structure of YB-1-RNA complexes</bold>. 30 nM Luciferase RNA was incubated in buffer M with 5% glycerol alone (lanes 1 and 2) or in the presence of 2.1 &#x003bc;M YB-1 (lanes 3, 4 and 5) for 10 min at 25&#x000b0;C.

In eukaryotes, Y-box proteins are regulators of transcription and translation and play important roles during the development and in cell proliferation and transformation. Here, we report that YB-1 interacts with tubulin and microtubules <italic>in vitro </italic>and demonstrate that this protein promotes the assembly of microtubules. This new functional link of cellular proteins seems to be important, since, on the one hand, the regulation of many vital processes, such as cell division, motility and intracellular traffic depends on the fine tuning of the intrinsic dynamics of microtubules by protein partners. The inventory of tubulin partners is not complete and the comprehension of their mechanisms of regulation of microtubule dynamics is still under investigation. On the other hand, with YB-1 being an RNA-binding protein, the study of YB-1:tubulin interaction is highly relevant to further address the competition between tubulin and mRNA for YB-1 binding. The conformational changes of RNP containing YB-1 induced by tubulin may be of particular interest to investigate RNP accessibility for translation and degradation.</p><sec><title>YB-1 strongly interacts with tubulin</title><p>The strong binding between YB-1 and tubulin was supported by a series of <italic>in vitro </italic>biochemical data which also demonstrated that the YB-1:tubulin interaction was independent of the presence of other tissue extract components. Since YB-1 is positively charged at neutral pH (pI ~ 9.5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] while tubulin is negatively charged (pI ~ 5.6) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], we assayed if YB-1 interacts with tubulin in a manner similar to that of many other positively charged nucleic acid binding proteins. As tubulin was still retained on a YB-1 column at physiological ionic strength, we concluded that the attraction between tubulin and YB-1 was the result of a strong, short-ranged, electrostatic interactions and (or) other more specific mechanisms like hydrophobic interactions. Additionally, we found that YB-1 did not provoke the formation of huge aggregates containing tubulin, in contrast to other highly cationic proteins like histones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The YB-1-tubulin oligomeric complexes formed in "non-assembly conditions" had their heights about 7 nm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), which indicated the involvement of a few YB-1 and tubulin molecules in formation of these complexes.</p><p>Microtubule polymerization is a two-step process in which tubulin first forms nucleation templates and then adds to and elongates them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The templates were modelled either in equilibrium with tubulin dimers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] or as persistent structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. MAPs facilitate the formation of templates and are thought to clamp them. The YB-1-tubulin complexes we observed here were functionally reminiscent of MAPs-tubulin complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The YB-1-tubulin complexes could represent nucleation templates, and thus, YB-1 could act as a nucleation factor for microtubule assembly <italic>in vitro </italic>in a manner similar to that of classical MAPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>YB-1 favours microtubule assembly and coats the microtubule wall</title><p>YB-1 strongly favoured polymerization of pure tubulin into microtubules. YB-1 was found to accelerate the apparent rate of microtubule assembly, to increase the microtubule mass at steady state and to be associated with microtubules.</p><p>The ability of MAPs or other non-specific basic molecules to promote microtubule assembly depends largely upon the presence of the negative charges of tubulin C-termini [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In contrast to these positively charged molecules, we found that YB-1, which is also a basic protein, still stimulated polymerization of tubulin cleaved by subtilisin. This observation suggests that the promotion of microtubule assembly by YB-1 results not only from purely electrostatic interactions but also from a more specific molecular recognition mechanism. This suggestion is supported by the fact that most positively charged molecules which interact in a non-specific manner with tubulin promote the assembly of tubulin into aberrant structures instead of microtubules. For example, polycations induce the formation of double-walled microtubules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases promote microtubule bundling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. In the present work, electron microscopy analysis showed that microtubules formed in the presence of YB-1 possess a normal morphology with a single wall of circa 25 nm diameter and parallel AFM investigations showed that YB-1 can coat the outer surface of the microtubule wall.</p><p>In agreement with these microscopic data, YB-1 was found to co-sediment with microtubules (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The stoichiometry corresponds well to some other microtubule-binding proteins with single tubulin dimer-binding site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Many canonic MAPs were reported to bind microtubules with a stoichiometry ranging from 1:15 to 1:8 (MAPs:tubulin ratio in the microtubule wall) probably because of multiple tubulin-binding sites and high molecular mass of these proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>YB-1 promotes polymerization of MAPs-tubulin</title><p>In the presence of MAPs-tubulin, YB-1 also accelerated microtubule assembly, although it didn't promote an increase of the total mass of polymerized tubulin. This was most probably due to the fact that our MAPs-tubulin preparation contained around 15% of MAPs (w/w), which makes microtubules nearly saturated with MAPs. Interestingly, some high molecular weight MAPs were partially displaced by YB-1 from MAPs-microtubules stabilized with taxol when the total YB-1-tubulin molar ratio was above 0.5 (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). As mentioned above, classical MAPs, such as tau and MAP2, interact mostly with the negatively charged C-termini of tubulin. In addition, tau binds to the amino terminal region of alpha tubulin subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Since YB-1 strongly promoted assembly of tubulin lacking C-termini, we predict that YB-1 interacts with microtubules not only via non-specific binding to the negatively charged C-terminal tail. Finally, in this context, it is interesting to note that YB-1 doesn't display any homology with classical MAPs and may represent the generic element of a novel class of microtubule interacting proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>YB-1 may shuttle between mRNA and the microtubule cytoskeleton <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>Microtubules play a critical role in mRNA translation and localization <italic>in vivo </italic>(reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]). Numerous plant proteins known to regulate translation were recently identified by affinity chromatography as tubulin-binding proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. For example, the plant initiation factor eIF-(iso)4F was found associated with the microtubule cytoskeleton in the cell and is able to induces microtubule bundling <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].</p><p>Since YB-1 is a major component of cellular RNPs, interaction of tubulin with YB-1 could potentially regulate the translation state of mRNAs. Indeed, YB-1 protects mRNAs from degradation and packs them in non-translatable RNPs. We have shown here that tubulin changes the electrophoretic mobility of YB-1-RNA complexes. This change most probably occurs due to the partial dissociation of YB-1 from RNA, which could be a signal to trigger mRNA translation and/or degradation. Interestingly, it has recently been shown that the phosphorylation of YB-1 by Akt kinase may regulate its binding to mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. It is thus expected that the phosphorylated form of YB-1, which possesses a lower affinity for the cap-structure of mRNA, could be more easily released from RNA than its non-phosphorylated form. This release could occur due to interaction of mRNA with other RNA-binding proteins or through the interaction of YB-1 with protein partners, such as tubulin. Our results thus provide new prospects on the role of protein-protein interaction in the regulation of mRNA translation. Furthermore, these results could also help to unravel situations where tubulin is involved in the overall processes of mRNA translation and degradation.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Thus, we have first demonstrated that YB-1 stimulates microtubule assembly <italic>in vitro</italic>.
