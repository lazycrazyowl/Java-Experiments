Among ascomycetes, <italic>Trichoderma reesei </italic>is a model organism of cellulose and hemicellulose degradation, used for its unique secretion ability especially for cellulase production. <italic>T. reesei </italic>has only been reported as a cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic organism although genome annotation revealed 6 laccase-like multicopper oxidase (LMCO) genes. The purpose of this work was i) to validate the function of a candidate LMCO gene from <italic>T. reesei</italic>, and ii) to reconstruct LMCO phylogeny and perform evolutionary analysis testing for positive selection.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>After homologous overproduction of a candidate LMCO gene, extracellular laccase activity was detected when ABTS or SRG were used as substrates, and the recombinant protein was purified to homogeneity followed by biochemical characterization. The recombinant protein, called TrLAC1, has a molecular mass of 104 kDa. Optimal temperature and pH were respectively 40-45&#x000b0;C and 4, by using ABTS as substrate. TrLAC1 showed broad pH stability range of 3 to 7. Temperature stability revealed that TrLAC1 is not a thermostable enzyme, which was also confirmed by unfolding studies monitored by circular dichroism. Evolutionary studies were performed to shed light on the LMCO family, and the phylogenetic tree was reconstructed using maximum-likelihood method. LMCO and classical laccases were clearly divided into two distinct groups. Finally, Darwinian selection was tested, and the results showed that positive selection drove the evolution of sequences leading to well-known laccases involved in ligninolysis. Positively-selected sites were observed that could be used as targets for mutagenesis and functional studies between classical laccases and LMCO from <italic>T. reesei</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Homologous production and evolutionary studies of the first LMCO from the biomass-degrading fungus <italic>T. reesei </italic>gives new insights into the physicochemical parameters and biodiversity in this family.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Lignin degradation is a key step for recycling the carbon fixed by photosynthesis, and to date, basidiomycetes are the most efficient naturally-found lignin degraders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Lignin attack is a complex oxidative process in which heme peroxidases oxidize lignin subunits using extracellular hydrogen peroxide generated by unrelated oxidases as a co-substrate. A second enzyme group involved in lignin degradation is the multicopper oxidases (laccases) that oxidize lignin subunits with molecular oxygen as the electron acceptor. Different fungal lignocellulose degradation strategies have been reported, and a better understanding of ligninolysis could be achieved by screening the "computational biodiversity" found in fungal genomes. Gene networks could then be highlighted and correlated to the lignin-degrading ability of different fungal strains. For this purpose, dedicated databases, namely CAZy [[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cazy.org">http://www.cazy.org</ext-link>] and FOLy [[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://foly.esil.univ-mrs.fr">http://foly.esil.univ-mrs.fr</ext-link>] were designed to annotate the genes involved in the (hemi)cellulolytic and ligninolytic processes, respectively. In the FOLy database there is an inventory of laccases (benzenediol-oxygen-oxidoreductase, EC1.10.3.2), which are copper-containing oxidases able to oxidize a wide range of aromatic compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Based on multiple sequence alignments of more than 100 laccases, four ungapped sequences regions (L1-L4) were evidenced in laccases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The copper ligands include 12 amino acids that are housed within these conserved regions. Moreover, four loop regions (I, II, III, and IV) were identified and suggested to be involved in substrate binding on the basis of 3D structure superimposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Phenols are typical substrates of laccases (syringaldazine, DMP and guaiacol) but laccases are also able to oxidize electron donor substrates such as ABTS [2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)] or ferrocyanide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Laccases are attractive environmentally-friendly enzymes that have shown potential for a variety of applications. Laccases find potential applications in pulp delignification and biobleaching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], dye-bleaching in the textile and dye industries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], treatment of wastewater [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], removal of phenolic compounds in beverages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], biosensor and biofuel cell construction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and products of pharmaceutical importance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Whereas laccases are well-known ligninolytic enzymes in basidiomycetes, their role in ascomycetes is still being unravelled. Potential laccases have been already reported in ascomycetes in which laccases were supposed to be involved in the melanin-like pigment synthesis in conidiospores, in the induction of fruiting bodies, and finally in pathogenic interaction with plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Complete annotations of the potential ligninolytic systems were recently produced using FOLy, providing initial comparative insight into the diversity of fungal lignin degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Putative laccase-related genes (called LO1 according our classification) were interestingly identified in <italic>Trichoderma reesei </italic>and other ascomycetes. <italic>T. reesei </italic>is a mesophilic soft-rot ascomycete fungus producing high levels of cellulases and hemicellulases that are also commercially used to modify and hydrolyze plant cell wall polysaccharides.

The concentrate was dialyzed against the binding buffer (30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0) and His-tagged recombinant protein was purified on a Chelating Sepharose Fast Flow column (13 &#x000d7; 15 cm; Amersham Biosciences) previously charged with 0.4 M NiSO<sub>4 </sub>solution, and equilibrated with five column volumes of binding buffer.

The raw dataset was manually filtered to eliminate potentially non-homologous sequences, disturbing alignments and duplicates. Sequences retrieved were only focused on scope TaxeID = 4751 (fungal kingdom). An alignment was created using MUSCLE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and large gaps were manually eliminated. A default parameter for gap columns thresholds was set at 0.85. A bias correction phase was used to eliminate: i) sequences with a diverging composition, using an amino-acid composition test bundled with TREE-PUZZLE software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] with an alpha risk set to 5%. From this alignment, a phylogenetic tree was generated using maximum likelihood methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].

The final alignment contained 290 codons for the dataset.</p><p>The codeml program of the PAML (Phylogenetic Analysis by Maximum Likelihood; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>];) 3.15 software package was applied to test for positive selection. PAML uses a maximum likelihood algorithm to assign likelihood scores to different models for selection. If a model incorporating positive selection gave a higher likelihood score than a null model without positive selection, this constitutes evidence for positive selection. Model A implemented by Yang &#x00026; Nielsen was used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. This model enables &#x003c9; (= dN/dS) to vary both between sites and between lineages, and was implemented in the maximum likelihood framework. Branch A tested for positive selection was labelled as foreground branch, and all remaining branches were labelled as background branches. This model was then used to construct two likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) by comparison against models that do not identify positive selection. The null hypothesis for test 1 is the site model M1a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] which assumes two site classes with 0 &#x0003c; &#x003c9;0 &#x0003c; 1 and &#x003c9;1 = 1 for all branches. For test 2, the null hypothesis is the branch-site model A but with &#x003c9;2 = 1 fixed.

Annotation was focused on enzymes potentially involved in the degradation of lignin and related aromatic compounds. Surprisingly, 6 genes were annotated as laccase-like multicopper oxidase encoding genes (LMCO): jgi|124079|, jgi|122948|, jgi|5119|, jgi|54239|, jgi|102820| and jgi|121098|. Among these candidate genes, model 124079 was selected for further functional investigation for its characteristic motif identification and sequence similarity with classical laccase proteins. This gene is 2193 bp in length and contains 5 introns. The genomic context of this gene was studied to exclude the possibility that it is a pseudogene. The promoter sequence contained CAAT and TATAA boxes at -658 and -109, respectively. Searches for specific regulatory elements revealed 21 heat-shock elements (HSE) and one nitrogen metabolite regulation (NIT2-like). Interestingly, two putative metal response elements and one xenobiotic response element involved in laccase gene regulation in white-rot fungi were identified but located downstream of the ATG (+41; +102 and +11, respectively). The functionality of these regulatory elements needs to be experimentally verified. The corresponding protein, called TrLAC1, contains 623 aa and possesses a classical signal peptide of 20 aa. Structure prediction of TrLAC1 is similar to laccases from basidiomycetes such as <italic>Trametes </italic>species and <italic>Pycnoporus cinnabarinus </italic>(data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Homologous overexpression of the laccase-like gene|124079|</title><p>Codons of gene|124079| were optimized to perfectly fit the general <italic>Trichoderma reesei </italic>codon usage. Non-optimized and optimized DNA sequences showed an identity of 77,9%. The signal sequence of the laccase genes itself was used in the expression cassette. Six histidine codons were introduced to the C-terminus to provide a tag for subsequent protein purification. Gene expression was regulated by the inducible <italic>cbh1 </italic>promoter and <italic>chb1 </italic>terminator. <italic>T. reesei </italic>RUTC-30 was co-transformed with the genetic cassette including gene|124079|cloned in the expression vector PAMH110, and a vector containing the hygromycin resistance selection marker. Transformants were selected for their ability to grow on solid minimum medium containing hygromycin. Transformants were first screened on plates based on the appearance of purple halos flagging ABTS oxidation. Secondly, approximately 125 colonies were screened by assaying laccase activity in the culture medium, and the best producer was selected for further analysis. The best-producer transformant was then cultured to study the time course of laccase activity. Laccase activity against ABTS was detected on day 2 and the activity increased until day 6 having the maximum activity of 0.6 nkat.mL<sup>-1</sup>. According to the specific activity determined for the purified enzyme, production yield was 280 mg.L<sup>-1</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Characterization of the recombinant TrLAC1 protein</title><sec><title>Molecular mass and protein identification</title><p>The electrophoretic mobility of the total secreted proteins in the culture medium was checked on SDS-PAGE (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Compared against the negative control (supernatant from wild-type strain, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, lane a), an additional band was visualized at ~104 kDa in the TrLAC1 transformant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, lane b). Recombinant TrLAC1 was purified through a one-step chromatographic strategy (IMAC). The homogeneity of the recombinant TrLAC1 was controlled by SDS-PAGE (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, lane c) and a single ~104 kDa band was detected. The deduced molecular mass of the predicted mature TrLAC1 is ~67 kDa, thus the experimental molecular mass of TrLAC1 could originate from variable mobility in SDS gel analysis and cellular processing such as glycosylations (the mature sequence reveals 6 consensus sites for <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation). Identification of the recombinant TrLAC1 was confirmed by tryptic digestion followed by MALDI-TOF analysis (data not shown). When the extracellular protein patterns of the parental strain and the best tranformants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, lanes a and b) were compared, it is evident that the most abundant band corresponding to the cellobiohydrolase CBHI is missing from the transformant.

Among them, <italic>T. reesei </italic>is a model organism of fungal decay of cellulose and hemicellulose, and its enzymes were demonstrated to have potential in production of bioethanol and other biological products from biomass. <italic>T. reesei </italic>is widely used for its unique secretion ability, especially for cellulase production. <italic>T. reesei </italic>fungus possesses 10 genes encoding well-known cellulases (endoglucanases and cellobiohydrolases) and 16 genes that encode hemicellulase genes classified in several CAZyme families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. <italic>T. reesei </italic>has never before been considered as a potentially lignin modifying fungus. The study of an endogenous LMCO in <italic>T. reesei</italic>, the biotechnological workhorse of the genus <italic>Trichoderma</italic>, is therefore of interest for the multiple biotechnological applications using this fungus and is important in an ecological context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>In literature, there are several records of laccases production by ascomycetes.

Laccase activity has also been evidenced in the tropical xylariaceous fungi that are probably responsible for the lignocellulolysis despite their slow decay ability <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. In addition, laccases were purified from phytopathogenic ascomycetes such as <italic>Gaeumannomyces graminis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], <italic>Magnaporthe grisea </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]<italic>Ophiostoma novo-ulmi </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]<italic>Mauginiella </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]<italic>Monocillium indicum </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], <italic>Neurospora crassa </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].</p><p>Concerning recombinant enzyme production, the expression of an ascomycete laccase-encoding gene from <italic>Melanocarpus albomyces </italic>was reported in <italic>T. reesei </italic>and the recombinant protein characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].

To date, no expression of these genes has been evidenced in <italic>T. reesei</italic>, and it could be hypothesized that a specific expression pattern strictly constraints expression.</p><p>Homologous overproduction assays were conducted for the gene jgi|124079|. The supernatant of the transformed strain showed laccase activity and the corresponding recombinant protein was named TrLAC1. Biochemical characterization revealed that this enzyme is active on typical specific laccase substrates including ABTS and syringaldazine. Interestingly, TrLAC1 has a higher pH optimum spectrum on syringaldazine compared to most of the other basidiomycete laccases (i.e. <italic>Pycnoporus cinnabarinus</italic>). The optimal pH of TrLAC1 is similar to laccases from the basidiomycete <italic>Cyathus stercoreus </italic>and the ascomycete <italic>Melanocarpus albomyces </italic>that have been reported to have optimal pH of 6-7 by using syringaldazine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, optimum pH differed strikingly according to the substrate used as the optimum pH was 7 with the phenolic substrate syringaldazine and 4 with the nonphenolic substrate ABTS. Such a behaviour has already been reported for other fungal laccases and could be explained by two phenomena: one generated by the redox potential difference between a reducing substrate and the type 1 copper of laccase and another generated by the binding of a hydroxide anion to the type 2/type 3 coppers of laccase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>].</p><p>In a biotechnological point of view, TrLAC1 represents a candidate for applications at alkaline pHs such as bioremediation of textile wastewaters and of wastewaters produced by chemical plants in the manufacturing organic molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Nevertheless, TrLAC1 had a low specific activity on ABTS as compared to basidiomycete laccases. For instance, <italic>P. cinnabarinus </italic>laccase has a specific activity ~800 times higher on ABTS than TrLAC1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Positively selected sites in TrLAC1 could be specifically targeted in future to study their impact in the enzymatic efficiency.</p><p>There are surprisingly few studies focused on the diversity and function of LMCO genes in soil-inhabiting ascomycetes, despite their probable role in plant litter decay processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. In order to screen the gene biodiversity of potential laccases from Ascomycotina, a phylogenetic tree was constructed using maximum likelihood analysis. Numerous homologs of TrLAC1 were observed in the Ascomycotina group, especially in the <italic>Aspergilli</italic>. For instance, <italic>Aspergillus niger </italic>CBS513.88 has 5 potential candidate homologous genes similar to LMCO. Interestingly, a paralog was identified in <italic>T. reesei </italic>(jgi|54239|). In an evolutionary point of view, functional characterization of this candidate protein could be useful to understand the evolution of LMCO in <italic>T. reesei </italic>and to unravel the fate of duplicates in genome. Functional characterization has not been performed in the Ascomycotina group, and TrLAC1 characterization could therefore be useful for future evolutionary-based functional annotation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>].</p><p>In order to shed light on the evolutionary history of laccases, branches leading to well-known ligninolytic laccases were targeted for testing selective pressure. Positive selection was detected, and specific sites were evidenced. Comparing these positively-selected sites to the laccase from Ascomycotina could target potential sites for future directed mutagenesis research. Hybrid laccases combining Ascomycotina sequences and positively-selected sites identified in Basidiomycotina could prove useful for testing new physico-chemical properties for biotechnology applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>].
