Secondary metabolites have a strong impact on humankind via their application in health, medicine, agriculture, and industry; they include useful (e.g. antibiotics) and detrimental compounds (e.g. mycotoxins).</p><p>Filamentous fungi produce a broad range of secondary metabolites. Each fungal species can synthesize multiple secondary metabolites, and these metabolites vary from species to species as well thus enabling the use of secondary metabolite profiling in the chemotaxonomy of filamentous fungi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The complex network of secondary metabolism is connected to basic (primary) metabolism. Secondary metabolites are derived from compounds formed during primary metabolism, e.g. amino acids, nucleotides, carbohydrates, acyl-CoA (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]). Each secondary metabolic pathway accomplishes its specific function (although often unknown) as part of cellular metabolism and appears to provide "active safety" mechanisms for the producer enhancing survival in the continuously changing environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p><italic>Aspergillus spp</italic>. produce an array of secondary metabolites including aflatoxin, cyclopiazonic acid, aflatrem, patulin, penicillin, kojic acid, lovastatin, carotenoids, and spore pigments; novel secondary metabolites have also been discovered that are synthesized from so called silent gene clusters in <italic>A. nidulans</italic>, such as terrequinone A, monodictyphenone, emodins, and polyketides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Fungal-bacterial physical interactions have been shown to induce silent secondary metabolic gene cluster expression in <italic>A. nidulans </italic>required for biosynthesis of the polyketide orsellinic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Aflatoxin biosynthesis is one of the most highly characterized secondary metabolic pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In contrast, pathways for the synthesis of many other secondary metabolites, e.g. patulin, cyclopiazonic acid, aflatrem, and kojic acid, are poorly understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Molecular regulation of aflatoxin biosynthesis is complex and involves control of gene expression at the level of the individual gene and at the level of the entire gene cluster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Biosynthesis of aflatoxin initiates during a transition from exponential growth to stationary phase, and closely correlates with fungal development (conidiospore, cleistothecia, and sclerotia formation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. AflR, a positive aflatoxin pathway regulator, is a transcription factor that controls at least in part expression of several genes in the aflatoxin gene cluster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. VeA, a global regulator of secondary metabolism, links response to light with secondary metabolism and fungal development; this response is mediated through formation of a protein complex VelB/VeA/LaeA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. LaeA is a nuclear methyl transferase that through protein-protein interactions mediates regulation of secondary metabolism and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Aflatoxin biosynthesis is precisely orchestrated within the cell; the early reactions are reported to occur in peroxisomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]; recent evidence from our laboratory suggests that specific early steps as well the middle and late steps are carried out in specialized trafficking vesicles, called aflatoxisomes, which are also involved in export of the toxin outside the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. A novel role for VeA in coordination of aflatoxisome development with aflatoxin biosynthesis was recently discovered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Biosynthesis of aflatoxins appears to fulfill multiple biochemical and biological functions including removal of acetate, protection of the genome from UV damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], quenching oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], protection from insects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], and regulation of conidiation, and sclerotia development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>In order to manipulate efficiently secondary metabolism (to enhance production of beneficial metabolites and to control production of detrimental ones) we must understand the "molecular switch" mechanism that controls the initiation of secondary metabolism. Reaching this understanding requires a cooperative effort from genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic research. Despite advances in knowledge about the genes involved in biosynthesis and the regulation of many secondary metabolitic pathways, a detailed understanding of how secondary metabolism integrates with other metabolic and cellular processes is still not available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>Metabolomics is a powerful tool to characterize the metabolic state of the cell and to discover new metabolites and biochemical pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Volatiles, one important group of cellular metabolites, represent a significant portion of the metabolome. Many organic compounds are present in the volatile phase including acids, alcohols, aldehydes, esters, short chain fatty acids, lipid oxides, terpenes, and phenolics. In this study we applied volatile profiling analysis for gaining rapid access to information on intracellular metabolism in the fungus. Specifically, we examined carbon flow in the presence or absence of secondary metabolism in <italic>A. parasiticus </italic>using wild type and mutant strains carrying genetic defects specifically in aflatoxin biosynthesis and in VeA, a global regulator of secondary metabolism. The volatile metabolites generated by the fungus were analyzed using solid phase microextraction - gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (SPME-GC/MS). This analytical approach is a non-invasive and solvent-free absorption technique that is used in analysis of volatile compounds from the headspace above the sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]; the technique has been widely employed in volatile analysis (profiling) of plants, yeast, and bacteria because it is accurate, sensitive, and robust [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. To conduct this procedure, the outer polymer coating of a fused silica fiber absorbs volatiles from the headspace in the growth environment; the volatiles are then desorbed in the hot GC inlet and chromotographed in the usual manner. The separated compounds are subsequently identified by mass spectrometry.</p><p>Using SPME-GC/MS volatile profiling analysis we demonstrated that a genetic block in aflatoxin biosynthesis or disruption of the global regulator <italic>veA </italic>re-directs intracellular carbon flow. Specifically, we observed that VeA negatively regulates catabolism of branched chain amino acids and the synthesis of ethanol in <italic>A. parasiticus</italic>; these metabolic changes were mediated at least in part at the transcriptional level. We also showed that volatile metabolites generated under the control of VeA may participate in the molecular machinery that regulates conidiation and sclerotia formation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Profiling of volatile compounds in <italic>A. parasiticus </italic>SU-1</title><p>We withdrew samples from cultures at regular intervals during growth and analyzed volatiles following a 1 to 2 h equilibration period; this sampling method resulted in stable and reproducible measurements. We also analyzed volatile compounds in a control injection that originated from the SPME fiber, the glass vial, and the screw cap and valve; these volatiles were excluded from the analysis of volatiles detected in the fungal culture headspace. The relative amounts of volatiles produced in culture were assessed based on instrument response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]; these compounds were designated as possible, or putative, fungal metabolites since they could be identified by comparison with a mass spectrum library. Since the <italic>A. parasiticus </italic>strains used in the study (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) did not differ significantly in growth rate in liquid YES medium (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>, Figure S1), the relative intensity change of all masses detected was also related to the levels of the compounds produced in culture. Compounds with no match in the NIST mass spectrum library were defined as unknown. Ethanol levels produced by the fungus in culture were compared to standards. Thus, all volatiles detected fell into one of three categories: 1) known compounds identified with standards (ethanol); 2) putative compounds identified by a match in NIST mass spectrum library; and 3) unknown compounds.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Strains used in the study</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Strain</th><th align="left">Genotype</th><th align="left">Source</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><italic>A. parasiticus </italic>SU-1 (ATCC 56775)</td><td align="left">wild type</td><td align="left">ATCC</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>A. parasiticus </italic>ATCC 36537</td><td align="left"><italic>ver-1 wh </italic></td><td align="left">ATCC</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>A. parasiticus </italic>&#x00394;<italic>ve</italic>A (TJW35.21)</td><td align="left"><italic>ver-1 wh pyrG<sup>- </sup>&#x00394;veA::pyrG </italic></td><td align="left">Calvo <italic>et al</italic>., 2004 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>A. parasiticus </italic>AFS10 (ATCC 24690)</td><td align="left"><italic>aflR</italic></td><td align="left">Cary <italic>et al</italic>., 2002 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>A. parasiticus </italic>B62</td><td align="left"><italic>niaD nor-1 br-1 </italic></td><td align="left">ATCC</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>A. nidulans </italic>FGSC4</td><td align="left">wild type</td><td align="left">FGSC</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>The volatile profile of SU-1 grown for 72 h in liquid YES (aflatoxin inducing conditions) in the dark revealed 24 putative fungal metabolites and 25 unknown compounds (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>, Figure S2).

Volatile compounds represent a significant portion of the metabolome and, as has been demonstrated in our study, they provide information on the real-time metabolic changes that occur within the fungal cell; most importantly from a practical stand point, this approach does not require quantification of the metabolites or cell disruption. We show that SPME-GC/MS is a sensitive, fast, and accurate approach to study changes in volatile compounds generated by the filamentous fungi.</p><p>Our studies demonstrate that <italic>A. parasiticus </italic>produces a variety of volatile organic compounds including several classes of intermediates and products associated with catabolism of the branched chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) and lipids; alcohols, organic acids, esters, and aldehydes were also detected. Our data suggest that <italic>A. parasiticus </italic>catabolizes free branched chain amino acids (endogenously synthesized, or exogenously added); these may either enter the catabolic pathway directly, or they could be used as a carbon source, thus producing detectable levels of metabolic cross talk.</p><p>2-ketoacids are also synthesized <italic>de novo </italic>as late intermediates in branched chain amino acid biosynthesis pathways; they can be converted to the corresponding alcohols and esters. Our feeding studies provide evidence that fungal volatile compounds originate from branched chain amino acids catabolism; however, we can not rule out the possibility that 2-ketoacids generated <italic>de novo </italic>through biosynthetic pathway serve as an additional precursor for volatile synthesis.</p><p>We also demonstrate that the number of volatile compounds produced in culture depends on the composition of the growth medium, the presence or absence of light, and also on the status of secondary metabolism in the fungal cell. A genetic block in aflatoxin biosynthesis in AFS10 and ATCC 36537 resulted in a decrease in formation of isoleucine- and valine-derived acids and esters; intermediates in leucine catabolism (except for 3-methylbutanal) were barely detected. These data support the idea that secondary metabolism (aflatoxin biosynthesis) is an integrated part of the cellular metabolism.</p><p>Our data show that disruption of secondary metabolic pathways in &#x00394;<italic>veA </italic>correlate with dramatic changes in carbon flow through primary metabolic pathways. The most significant metabolic changes were observed in catabolism of branched chain amino acids and formation of ethanol in <italic>A. parasiticus</italic>; the data strongly suggest that VeA acts as a negative regulator of these processes at the transcriptional level. Based on previous and current work, we propose a model for the association between secondary metabolism and catabolism of branched chain amino acids and ethanol biosynthesis in <italic>A. parasiticus</italic>; the model proposes that Velvet A plays a key regulatory role in the coordination of carbon flow through these metabolic processes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).</p><p>How can one explain the changes in carbon flow observed in &#x00394;<italic>ve</italic>A? Under conditions studied (liquid shake culture, no development occurs) disruption of <italic>veA </italic>is thought to impair most if not all of secondary metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Thus it is reasonable to suggest that the cell must re-structure and re-direct its metabolism and carbon flow in order to maintain cellular homeostasis. An increase in production of ethanol and branched chain alcohols and esters may serve as a compensatory mechanism to maintain cellular redox balance and to promote carbon removal from the cell. Our data suggest that, at least at the transcription level, accumulation of acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA in SU-1 are balanced by channeling through polyketide biosynthesis, the methylcitrate cycle, and ethanol formation. At 40 h, the &#x00394;<italic>veA </italic>strain, which is aberrant in secondary metabolism, compensates for the increase in accumulation of propionyl-CoA by increasing methylcitrate cycle activity as well as the formation of ethyl-propionate and corresponding esters. Acetyl-CoA is re-directed through ethanol biosynthesis. The block in secondary metabolism in &#x00394;<italic>veA</italic>, also directs carbon flow through formation of branched chain acyl-CoA-derived alcohols, acids and esters. At 72 h, these compensatory mechanisms in &#x00394;<italic>veA </italic>likely discontinue resulting in the accumulation of acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA, and in the activation of a feed-back inhibition mechanism that affects &#x003b2;-oxidation both in mitochondria and peroxisomes. In this scenario, VeA controls &#x003b2;-oxidation indirectly through accumulation of acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA. However, whether the effect of VeA on gene transcription is mediated directly through protein-protein interactions, indirectly through intracellular biochemical changes, or both, remains to be elucidated.</p><p>One alternative explanation for the observed changes in carbon flow in &#x00394;<italic>ve</italic>A relates to studies on the biosynthesis of polyketide antibiotics by <italic>Streptomyces spp</italic>. The polyketides virginiamycin, tautomycin, mananumycin, butyrolactols, and antraquinones are generated by condensation of starter units including isobutyryl-CoA, isovaleryl-CoA, and 2-methylbutyryl-CoA; the latter are derived from catabolism of the branched chain amino acids valine, leucine, and isoleucine respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>]. We propose that <italic>Aspergillus spp</italic>. synthesize polyketide(s) using branched acyl-CoA as precursors that originate through catabolism (or biosynthesis) of branched chain amino acids and or &#x003b2;-oxidation of fatty acids, and that <italic>veA </italic>positively regulates this biosynthetic pathway. Maggio-Hall et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] provided evidence that mitochondrial &#x003b2;-oxidation of fatty acids and catabolism of branched chain amino acids utilize the same acyl-CoA dehydrogenase encoded by <italic>scdA</italic>. We hypothesize that, in the presence of VeA, &#x003b2;-oxidation of fatty acids and catabolism of branched chain amino acids occur in mitochondria and provide the necessary starter units for biosynthesis of polyketides, similar to the situation observed in <italic>Streptomyces spp</italic>. In &#x00394;<italic>ve</italic>A, the biosynthesis of these polyketide(s) is blocked, which causes a shift in metabolism to stimulate accumulation of branched chain alcohols and branched chain esters (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). The regulatory feed back mechanisms underlie the decline in &#x003b2;-oxidation of fatty acids. Interestingly, valine is synthesized also in the mitochondrion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>]. Alternatively, <italic>A. parasiticus </italic>produces other secondary metabolites derived from branched chain amino acids. Future work is focused on testing the hypothesis stated above.</p><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p><bold>VeA controls intracellular carbon flow in <italic>Aspergillus parasiticus</italic></bold>. The schematic illustrates compartmentalization of biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, branched chain amino acid catabolism, and biosynthesis of ethanol in <italic>Aspergillus</italic>. Acetyl-CoA is produced in the mitochondrion, the peroxisome and in the cytoplasm; acetyl-CoA is the precursor of aflatoxin and other secondary metabolites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Early steps in aflatoxin biosynthesis occur in peroxisomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]; the middle and late steps take place in aflatoxisomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The biosynthesis and catabolism of branched chain amino acids occur in the mitochondrion; branched chain acyl-CoAs serve as the precursors of branched chain acids, branched chain alcohols and branched chain esters. Acyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA serve as the precursors of the unknown polyketide X. Ethanol is produced through nonoxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate followed by conversion of acetaldehyde to ethanol by alcoholdehydrogenase; acety-CoA may also be converted to ethanol. VeA negatively regulates branched chain amino acid catabolism and ethanol biosynthesis. In addition, VeA is a positive regulator of &#x003b2;-oxidation of fatty acids in mitochondria and peroxisomes during the late stages of stationary phase. When secondary metabolism is blocked in &#x00394;<italic>veA</italic>, carbon flow is re-directed to elevated ethanol production and branched chain amino acid-derived volatiles. Overall, VeA is "a master-coordinator", which plays a role in regulation of carbon flow through metabolic processes (primary and secondary) in different cellular compartments.

This strain accumulates the aflatoxin pathway intermediate versicolorin A due to a point mutation in Ver-1A at nucleotide residue 287 (G to A) thus resulting in a non-functional enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>].

CS10 was in turn generated from <italic>A. parasiticus </italic>ATCC36537 by spontaneous mutation using N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine followed by enzymatic analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>].</p><p>YES liquid medium (contains 2% yeast extract and 6% sucrose; pH 5.8) was used as an aflatoxin inducing growth medium. A chemically defined glucose minimal salts (GMS) medium supplemented with 5 &#x003bc;M Zn<sup>2+ </sup>was prepared as described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>]. YGT medium (0.5% [wt/vol] yeast extract, 2% [wt/vol] glucose, and 1 ml of trace element solution per liter of medium) was prepared as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Coconut agar medium was prepared as described by Mahanti et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. 10<sup>4 </sup>spores/ml were inoculated into liquid medium.</p><p>To analyze the effect of fungal volatiles on aflatoxin biosynthesis and fungal development, the fungus was grown in 60 &#x000d7; 15 mm Petri dish lids. 10<sup>4 </sup>spores were center inoculated onto the agar medium. Three lids were placed inside a larger, 150 &#x000d7; 15 mm Petri dish as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. This system allowed free gas and volatile exchange between colonies inside the large dish while preventing direct colony contact.</p><p>Growth of <italic>A. parasiticus </italic>strains was estimated by dry weight of the mycelia.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>]. ELISA provided an estimation of AFB<sub>1 </sub>levels, whereas TLC enabled one to estimate levels of AFB<sub>1</sub>, AFB<sub>2</sub>, AFG<sub>1</sub>, and AFG<sub>2</sub>. Norsolorinic acid was extracted from the agar and mycelium with chloroform and then acetone, and its quantity was analyzed by TLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluation of conidiation</title><p><italic>A. parasiticus </italic>conidia were harvested and their number per colony was estimated as described by Roze et al.

Twelve ml of fungal culture were harvested at regular intervals and dispensed into 22 ml clear screw cap vials equipped with Mininert<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Valves (all from Supelco, Bellefonte, PA). Vials with cultures were pre-equilibrated at 30&#x000b0;C (the same temperature we used for fungal growth) in a water bath for at least 30 min, shaking at 50 rpm, before headspace gases were sampled at 30&#x000b0;C. A 65 &#x003bc;m PDMS/DVB SPME fiber (Supelco) was conditioned at 250&#x000b0;C overnight. Sampling was performed at 30&#x000b0;C by placing the fiber through the Mininert Valve into the headspace above the fungal culture for 3 min. Vials were continuously swirled at 100 rpm during incubation and SPME exposure. <italic>GC/MS parameters</italic>. Volatiles were desorbed from the fiber in a gas chromatograph (HP-6890, Hewlett-Packard Co., Wilmington, DE) injection port for 3 min; absorption and desorption time was optimized as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Volatiles were separated on a 29 m/250 &#x003bc;m i.d. capillary column HP-5MS (Hewlett-Packard Co., Wilmington, DE) having a film thickness 0.25 &#x003bc;m. The first 20 cm of the column was cooled with liquid nitrogen during the desorption process to cryofocus the volatiles. Ultrapure helium (99.999%) was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. The initial temperature of the column (40&#x000b0;C) was increased upon removal of liquid nitrogen at 60&#x000b0;C/min to obtain a final temperature of 250&#x000b0;C, which was maintained for 1 min. Following chromatographic separation, metabolites were fragmented with an electron ionization source and ion masses were detected by time-of-flight mass spectrometry (FCD-650, LECO Corp., St. Joseph, MI). Preliminary identification of metabolites was achieved by comparison of their mass spectra with those of authenticated chemical standards contained in a mass spectrum library (National Institute for Standard Technology, Search Version 1.5, Gaithersburg, MD). A total of 4 to10 biological replicates were performed for each strain and condition. Only compounds detected in 50% or more replicates were then confirmed by comparison of their GC retention time, MS ion spectra and retention index (RI). Finally, the compounds with probability values below 70% were rejected.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethanol measurements</title><p>Twelve ml of fungal culture were dispensed into 22 ml clear screw cap vials equipped with Mininert<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Valves (all from Supelco).
