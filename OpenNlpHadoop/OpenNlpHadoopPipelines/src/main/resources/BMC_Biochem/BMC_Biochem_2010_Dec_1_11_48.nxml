When bound to GTP, they are in an active conformation. Hydrolysis of GTP to GDP causes an inactivating conformational change. Racs are post-translationally modified by the removal of C-terminal amino acid residues, followed by the attachment of a lipid moiety in the form of a geranyl-geranyl group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>Because of this modification, mature Rac proteins are lipophilic and are only present in the cytosol when bound to the chaperone and transport protein RhoGDI. RhoGDI regulates the movement of Rac between the cytosol and membranes. Moreover, a recent study showed that Rho proteins compete for binding to a limited pool of RhoGDI, which, once it has bound them, provides stabilization and protection from degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>There are only three distinct RhoGDI proteins, of which RhoGDI&#x003b1; is the most ubiquitously expressed. The structure of RhoGDI bound to small GTPases has been elucidated. Rac makes contact with both N-and C-terminal regions in RhoGDI, with its hydrophobic tail fitting into a pocket in the C-terminal part of RhoGDI. However, the exact mechanism by which binding and release of Racs from RhoGDI is mediated is not well known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>RhoGDI can be phosphorylated on serine S101 and S174 by the serine/threonine kinase Pak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and PKC&#x003b1; also phosphorylates RhoGDI&#x003b1;, on residue S96 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Interestingly, constitutively activated oncogenic Src, which has a deregulated tyrosine kinase activity, was shown to phosphorylate RhoGDI&#x003b1; on tyrosine residue Y156 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In the current study we report that a normal cellular tyrosine kinase which is member of the Src family, Fer, is able to specifically tyrosine phosphorylate RhoGDI&#x003b1; and that this can regulate the binding to Rac1.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>The <italic>BCR/ABL </italic>oncogene encodes a chimeric protein that contains most of the Abl tyrosine kinase. Proteomic analysis of cells transfected with Bcr/Abl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] reported changes in phosphorylation of RhoGDI. To investigate if the deregulated Bcr/Abl tyrosine kinase, similar to oncogenic Src [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], is able to modify RhoGDI&#x003b1;, we performed an immunocomplex kinase assay with cells expressing Bcr/Abl or with Fer, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase related to Abl, in the presence of added recombinant GST-RhoGDI&#x003b1; or control GST. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, left panel, the Bcr/Abl protein exhibited strong autophosphorylation activity, as expected. However, there was very little phosphorylated RhoGDI&#x003b1;. In contrast, there was a prominent signal of phosphorylated RhoGDI&#x003b1; in the sample expressing Fer (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> right panel).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Fer forms a complex with RhoGDI&#x003b1; and phosphorylates it on tyrosine</bold>.

As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, left panel, Fer-WT clearly co-immunoprecipitated with RhoGDI&#x003b1;, which was phosphorylated on tyrosine, as judged by Western blotting using phosphotyrosine antibodies. In the converse experiment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, right panel, Fer IP) we confirmed the interaction between Fer-WT and RhoGDI&#x003b1;. In the presence of the Fer mutant lacking tyrosine kinase activity, no tyrosine phosphorylated RhoGDI&#x003b1; was detected, indicating that Fer tyrosine kinase activity is directly or indirectly needed to generate tyrosine phosphorylated RhoGDI&#x003b1;. Interestingly, the kinase-defective Fer protein exhibited a reduced ability to form a complex with RhoGDI&#x003b1; (compare lanes in IP Fer, IB for RhoGDI&#x003b1;), suggesting that the binding of these two proteins is facilitated by tyrosine phosphorylation. This is in agreement with the finding that the isolated Fer SH2 domain binds to RhoGDI&#x003b1; on far-Western blots (not shown). Importantly, we also were able to co-immunoprecipitate endogenous Fer with endogenous RhoGDI&#x003b1; in a lysate of the mast cell line RBL-2H3. This indicates that the complex formation between RhoGDI&#x003b1; and Fer also takes place without overexpression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>).</p><p>Although reactive oxygen species (ROS) were originally identified as a bactericidal mechanism, a role for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>as secondary messenger has now been well-established. Many groups suggest that Src may be a primary target of ROS, with some studies reporting activation of Src kinase activity upon ROS exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Since constitutively activated oncogenic Src had been shown to phosphorylate RhoGDI&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], we tested if exposure of c-Src to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>would activate it to phosphorylate RhoGDI&#x003b1;. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, in the presence of c-Src and after H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>exposure, we could detect tyrosine phosphorylated RhoGDI&#x003b1;. Sangrar et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] showed that ROS also induce Fer tyrosine autophosphorylation as well as trans-phosphorylation activity. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, we confirmed Fer activation by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>in different types of cells by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. In addition, when we co-transfected Fer with RhoGDI&#x003b1; and treated the cells with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, increased RhoGDI&#x003b1; tyrosine phosphorylation was detected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). The tyrosine phosphorylated RhoGDI&#x003b1; was visible as two discrete bands, indicating this protein is subject to processive phosphorylation.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Activation of Fer and non-oncogenic Src</bold>. (A) RhoGDI&#x003b1; was expressed alone or with c-Src as indicated above the panel. Cells in lanes marked with a "+" were stimulated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>(10 mM) for 15 minutes and RhoGDI&#x003b1; was immunoprecipitated. Anti-phosphotyrosine (pY20) blots were stripped and re-probed with RhoGDI&#x003b1; antibodies (Santa Cruz). (B) Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), mouse endothelial cells and cells transfected with Fer were treated with 5 mM of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>for the indicated time.

Wang et al. reported that pervanadate treatment allows detection of phosphorylation on RhoGDI&#x003b1; because this inhibits protein-tyrosine phosphatases and traps proteins in their tyrosine-phosphorylated form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Next, we examined if pervanadate would further activate Fer and increase RhoGDI&#x003b1; tyrosine phosphorylation. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, when cells co-expressing RhoGDI&#x003b1; and Fer were exposed to pervanadate for 5 minutes, a marked increase in tyrosine phosphorylation was seen both in Fer and RhoGDI&#x003b1; proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). The N-terminal regulatory domain of RhoGDI binds to the switch region of Rac whereas the C-terminal end adopts a conformation that accommodates the hydrophobic tail of Rac [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. To examine which domain interacts with Fer, we expressed the N- and C-terminus of RhoGDI&#x003b1; as Xpress-tagged proteins, together with Fer, and immunoprecipitated each fragment of RhoGDI&#x003b1; with Xpress antibodies. We could not detect a clear interaction of the N-terminal end with Fer (data not shown). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> (RhoGDI&#x003b1;-CT + Fer), in immunoprecipitates with the C-terminal end of RhoGDI&#x003b1; and in the presence of pervanadate, we recovered tyrosine-phosphorylated Fer. Moreover, this domain of RhoGDI&#x003b1; also was tyrosine phosphorylated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). This indicates that Fer interacts with and tyrosine phosphorylates residues in the part of RhoGDI&#x003b1; that includes the domain that binds to the C-terminal end of Rac. We were also able to demonstrate that endogenous RhoGDI&#x003b1; was phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to pervanadate, which activates Fer in RBL-2H3 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>).</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>C-terminal end of RhoGDI&#x003b1; is tyrosine phosphorylated</bold>. (A) RhoGDI&#x003b1; was expressed alone or with pEGFP-tagged Fer as indicated above the panel.

The RhoGDI&#x003b1; antibody was from Santa Cruz.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2091-11-48-3"/></fig><p>We used purified proteins to examine if tyrosine phosphorylation of RhoGDI&#x003b1; could regulate its ability to bind Rac. Fer was expressed as a GST fusion protein in baculovirus. In Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> (left panel), we first incubated GST-RhoGDI&#x003b1; with Rac to allow these proteins to form a complex. Then GST-Fer or control GST was added with a kinase reaction buffer and the kinase reaction was initiated. As shown in the top panel (pY20 blot), both autophosphorylation of Fer and transphosphorylation of RhoGDI&#x003b1; occurred as expected. However, there was no evidence that Rac was tyrosine phosphorylated (not shown). Rac protein was recovered in immunoprecipitates from both Fer-treated and non-Fer treated samples, indicating that the presence or absence of Fer does not affect preformed Rac-RhoGDI&#x003b1; complexes. A different result was obtained when Fer was first incubated with RhoGDI&#x003b1; and a kinase reaction was done. When Rac was subsequently added and allowed to bind, we found that it was not co-immunoprecipitated with RhoGDI&#x003b1; in the Fer-treated sample (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). The lack of binding of Rac to RhoGDI&#x003b1; could be because tyrosine-phosphorylated RhoGDI&#x003b1; has decreased affinity for Rac, or because the binding of Fer to RhoGDI&#x003b1; prevented subsequent binding of Rac to RhoGDI&#x003b1;. Interestingly, this effect is similar to that reported for oncogenic Src: when Src phosphorylated RhoGDI&#x003b1;, the affinity of RhoGDI&#x003b1; for Rac was also significantly reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Fer interferes with binding of RhoGDI&#x003b1; and Rac</bold>.

There is also increasing evidence that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>regulates the balance of tyrosine phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation in cells. The current study shows that non-oncogenic tyrosine kinases are likely to play a role in regulating the binding of Rac GTPases to RhoGDI&#x003b1; and through this, the cellular pool of Rac.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Antisera and DNA constructs</title><p>The Fer polyclonal rabbit anti-Fer CH-6 antiserum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and anti-Fer monoclonal rat antiserum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] have been previously described and were used for immunoprecipitation.

Samples were run on 8% SDS-PAGE gels and the radioactively labeled proteins visualized by autoradiography.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vitro</italic> binding assay for interaction of RhoGDI&#x003b1; and Rac1</title><p>To investigate possible binding of phosphorylated-RhoGDI&#x003b1; to Rac1, GST-RhoGDI&#x003b1; protein (50 pmol) was first combined with GST-Fer (25 pmol) or GST alone (25 pmol) in 100 &#x003bc;l of kinase buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 25 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT). 20 &#x003bc;M of ATP was added to the mixture, which was incubated for 30 min at 4&#x000b0;C for the kinase reaction. Next, 400 &#x003bc;l of binding buffer (1&#x000d7; DPBS, 0.1% IgePal, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mM DTT containing the protease inhibitors PMSF, leupeptin, and aprotinin) and 50 pmol Rac1 protein were added, followed by incubation for 1 h at 4&#x000b0;C. Incubation with antibody against RhoGDI&#x003b1; for 1 h at 4&#x000b0;C was followed by Protein A agarose addition and a second incubation 1 h at 4&#x000b0;C. To investigate if phosphorylation of RhoGDI&#x003b1; by Fer releases Rac1, GST-RhoGDI&#x003b1; protein was incubated with Rac1 in binding buffer for 1 h at 4&#x000b0;C; GST-Fer or GST alone was added, and a pull down with glutathione agarose was done, followed by washing of the precipitate. Kinase reactions were initiated by addition of kinase buffer and ATP for 30 min at 4&#x000b0;C.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>RhoGDI: Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor; ROS: reactive oxygen species</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>FF performed experiments, brought in new ideas and wrote part of the manuscript; S-M K performed experiments and wrote part of the manuscript; LH made the baculovirus Fer protein; PS provided critical reagents; JG designed experiments and provided critical input; NH provided ideas and wrote the manuscript.
