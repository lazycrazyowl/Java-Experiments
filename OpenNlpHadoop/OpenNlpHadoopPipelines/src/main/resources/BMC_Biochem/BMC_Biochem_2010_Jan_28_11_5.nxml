The remaining assay measures citrate synthase activity using a standard procedure.

Several acquired conditions are characterized not only by post-translational alterations in electron transport respiratory chain proteins and impairments in mitochondrial calcium handling, but also by abnormalities in TCAC enzymes. Examples include heart failure in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and stress-related heart dysfunction induced in rats by chronic restraint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Several inherited diseases have been ascribed to primary TCAC enzyme deficiencies (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). For instance, primary succinate dehydrogenase (SDH; EC.1.3.99.1) deficiency results either in tissue degeneration with devastating early-onset encephalomyopathy or in tissue proliferation with formation of paragangliomas or other tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Similarly, a mutation in the gene encoding fumarase (EC. 4.2.1.2) is a rare cause of encephalomyopathy and a far more common cause of leiomyomas of the skin and uterus and of renal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. TCAC dysfunction may also result from concurrent impairments in several steps of the cycle. For instance, combined deficiencies in SDH and aconitase (EC. 4.2.1.3) is observed in Friedreich's ataxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Primary deficiencies in tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes in humans.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Enzyme<sup>1</sup></th><th align="center">Clinical presentation</th><th align="center">References</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Fumarase</td><td align="center">1.

Organic acid accumulation has been proven instrumental in initiating tumor formation related to SDH or fumarase deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>The ratios between TCAC enzymes are consistent for each mammalian tissues presumably reflecting their metabolic demand, as shown three decades ago in the seminal study by Pette and Hofer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. This echoes the occurrence of metabolons in the mitochondrial matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], allowing for efficient channeling of substrates and co-factors through the Krebs cycle and related enzymes such as transaminase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Consequently, in addition to the determination of residual absolute activities, estimation of ratios between enzyme activities is an effective means of detecting partial but potentially harmful deficiencies. When used to assess respiratory chain activities, this approach enabled the identification of several gene mutations, even in patients with partial respiratory chain deficiencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>At present, TCAC enzyme activities are measured using a series of independent assays that are both laborious and time consuming. We therefore developed a limited set of assays allowing both measurement of all TCAC enzyme activities and detection of abnormalities in enzyme activity ratios. We used these assays successfully to detect severe and partial isolated deficiencies in several TCAC enzymes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Given that TCAC enzyme activity ratios, because of their consistency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], are important in comparing data between samples, we devised a method for measuring the activities of all eight TCAC enzymes using only three assays, which allows rapid determination of enzyme activity ratios. To define appropriate assay conditions, we first used mouse heart samples and assessed various parameters (detergent, pH, ionic force) that are known to independently stimulate each activity, but which might interfere with the measurement of other activities. We found that two media were sufficient for assaying all TCAC activities. The difference between these two media lies in the presence of phosphate required by some of the enzymes and in the use of electron acceptors to cope with the various reduced equivalents.</p><p>The first assay measures five enzymes sequentially in an individual sample (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Importantly, while four of these enzymes catalyze steps of the TCAC, one, GDH, is measured as a consequence of the required presence of glutamate for the assay of MDH. Glutamate is required for the added aspartate amino transferase reaction in order to transaminate the oxaloacetate produced by MDH, which otherwise would rapidly block this last enzyme (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). The biological sample is first added to a detergent-containing medium allowing substrates and electron acceptors free access to their respective binding sites on the proteins. However, we found that succinyl-CoA batches variably contained reducing agents capable of interacting with the electron acceptor mixture used in the assay. Therefore, the assay is started only after most of this non-enzymatic reaction is completed. Then, biological sample is added to enable measurement of the first enzyme, GTP- and/or ATP-forming succinyl-CoA ligase, based on the amount of succinate formed by the enzyme. The succinate is then readily oxidized to fumarate by SDH concomitantly with ultimate reduction of DCPIP. In this assay, electrons from succinate are transferred by SDH to either phenazine methosulfate or decylubiquinone, both capable of reducing DCPIP. Maximal SDH activity is then measured by adding a large amount of succinate. Adding malonate, a competitive SDH inhibitor, essentially abolishes DCPIP reduction. Subsequent addition of glutamate, because of the presence of added NAD<sup>+</sup>, allows estimation of NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent GDH activity. Depending on the enzyme activity levels in the sample, it may be necessary at this point to add more DCPIP before performing the next assays (fumarase and MDH activity). Fumarase is assayed by adding a large fumarate excess, which is readily converted to malate by fumarase, this latter acid being used up by MDH to produce NADH and oxaloacetate. Owing to the presence of added aspartate aminotransferase and glutamate, oxaloacetate does not accumulate and, therefore, does not slow the MDH reaction. The last enzyme of the assay, MDH, is then measured by adding 10 mM malate.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme assays</bold>. <bold>A</bold>, The first segment of the tricarboxylic acid cycle can be conveniently evaluated using a single assay to measure five enzymes by spectrophotometrically recording the reduction of DCPIP. The sequential assay begins by measurement of succinyl-CoA ligase activity based on oxidation of the produced succinate by succinate dehydrogenase, which forwards the electrons to the electron acceptors (DQ, DCPIP, and PMS). Coupling of these two activities to estimate succinyl-CoA ligase activity is permitted by the much higher activity of SDH than of succinyl-CoA ligase. After SDH inhibition by malonate, simultaneous addition of glutamate and aspartate aminotransferase ensures elimination of any oxaloacetate in the assay medium, thereby allowing further measurement of MDH activity. Incidentally, the required presence of NAD+ permits the measurement of glutamate dehydrogenase activity. Adding more DCPIP allows subsequent measurement of fumarase and MDH activity. Again, the coupling assay to estimate fumarase activity using MDH activity is permitted by the much higher activity of MDH. <bold>B</bold>, A second spectrophotometric assay subsequently measures pyridine dinucleotide reduction by three additional enzymes starting with &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. The next enzyme to be measured is aconitase, whose product, isocitrate, is readily oxidized by isocitrate dehydrogenase, producing NADPH. A saturating isocitrate concentration is finally added to enable measurement of isocitrate dehydrogenase activity. <bold>C</bold>, respective proportions of TCAC enzyme activities in mouse heart. The inset shows the TCAC depicted as two interacting enzyme cycles, A and B. Cycle A: &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (6), succinyl CoA ligase (1), succinate dehydrogenase (2), fumarase (4), and malate dehydrogenase (5); Cycle B: citrate synthase (9), aconitase (7), and isocitrate dehydrogenase (8). The two cycles interact via the activity of aspartate aminotransferase (10).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2091-11-5-1"/></fig><p>The second assay starts with measurement of the reduction of pyridine nucleotides (NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADP<sup>+</sup>) by KDH. This enzyme, one of the limiting steps of the TCAC, requires the presence of Ca<sup>++ </sup>ions, thiamine pyrophosphate, and coenzyme A to catalyze the oxidation of &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate. After KDH measurement, cis-aconitate is added for measurement of aconitase activity based on the formation of isocitrate, which, in the presence of IDH, is readily used up to reduce NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADP<sup>+</sup>. Finally, the maximal activity rate of IDH is determined after addition of a large isocitrate excess. Citrate synthase, the last TCAC enzyme to be measured, condenses acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate into citrate while concomitantly releasing coenzyme A, whose thiol residue readily reacts with Ellman's reagent (dithionitrobenzene). It is measured using the standard procedure which, in the case of cultured skin fibroblasts, concomitantly allows the detection of mycoplasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Since part of these assays relies on coupling between several successive enzymes, e.g., aconitase and IDH, we evaluated the proportionality/linearity of these assays as a function of protein concentration in heart sample homogenate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). For protein concentrations of up to 150 &#x003bc;g per ml, each assay exhibited a linear response. Given that the protein concentration presumably depends on the extent of mitochondria enrichment in the tissue/cell under study, linearity should be evaluated before running quantitative assays on any tissue/cell.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Proportionality between TCAC enzyme activities and protein concentration in mouse heart homogenate</bold>. 1-2, 4-8: Enzyme activities plotted as a function of protein concentration: succinyl-CoA ligase (1), succinate dehydrogenase (2), fumarase (4), malate dehydrogenase (5), &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (6), aconitase (7), and NADP<sup>+</sup>/NAD<sup>+</sup>-isocitrate dehydrogenase (8).

We first studied cultured human fibroblasts harboring mutations in either the <italic>SDHA </italic>or the <italic>fumarase </italic>gene (patients P1, P2; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b, c</xref>). In agreement with our previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], we found that the <italic>SDHA </italic>mutation caused an about 60% decrease, whereas the <italic>fumarase </italic>gene mutation resulted in nearly total loss of fumarase activity. Interestingly, the loss of SDH activity did not hamper our ability to measure succinyl-CoA ligase activity, which was roughly similar to the control value. Then, we evaluated whether our TCAC assay was able to detect partial loss (about 50%) of fumarase activity. We studied a lymphoblastoid cell line from a human patient (P3) harboring a heterozygous mutation in the <italic>fumarase </italic>gene, previously shown to result in a nearly complete loss of activity when associated with a loss of the corresponding allele in tumors. Again, our assay proved capable of detecting the predictable partial (~40%) loss of fumarase activity in these cells, in terms of both the absolute activity and the activity relative to the other TCAC enzymes in the sample (Fig, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3d</xref>). Finally, heart samples from a mouse heterozygous for a deleterious mutation in the <italic>SDHB </italic>gene (exon 2 deletion) were investigated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3e</xref>). We observed a consistent 40% decrease in SDH activity, as predicted by the heterozygous status of the animal.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Detection of severe and partial TCAC enzyme deficiencies in various biological samples</bold>.

Our previous work on the mitochondrial respiratory chain established that, in addition to absolute residual activities, relative ratios of enzyme activities in a metabolic pathway are effective in detecting even partial deficiencies in a given enzyme. We therefore developed a set of three assays that conveniently estimate all TCAC enzyme activities in tissue homogenates and permeabilized cells. Although the experimental conditions had to be adapted to allow for the measurement of many enzymes using a small number of assays, they were largely based on the pioneer work done in the 1940s by Krebs and colleagues[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In particular, the concentrations of substrates and cofactors and the metal requirements for each enzyme were as determined by these authors.</p><p>As a first result of this work, we fully confirmed that TCAC enzyme activity ratios in each of the different tissues or cell investigated are consistent under basal conditions, as previously observed by Pette and colleagues as early as 1960[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>To date there has been a lot of efforts to provide convenient assay procedures for respiratory chain enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In contrast, to our knowledge, there is no report on any convenient enzymatic procedure to measure the overall activity of TCAC enzymes in the context of screening procedures. Although our assays are rapid and sensitive, they have intrinsic limitations. First, three of the enzymes (succinyl-CoA ligase, fumarase, and aconitase) are measured via coupled assays involving the next enzyme in the cycle (SDH, MDH, and IDH, respectively). Obviously, a severe deficiency in the next enzyme would impair the ability of the assay to measure the first enzyme. Therefore, deficiencies in two consecutive enzymes should be evaluated by assaying each enzyme activity separately via standard methods. Second, although our assays are sufficiently sensitive to detect even partial deficiencies in one TCAC enzyme, measuring the slower enzymes via coupled assays (e.g., aconitase) requires a sample that is large enough to avoid problems with product dilution (e.g., isocitrate in the case of aconitase), which would impair the activity of the coupled enzyme (e.g., IDH in the case of aconitase). Despite these limitations, our set of assays enabled us to detect all TCAC enzyme deficiencies. Even a 40% decrease in fumarase activity in lymphoblastoid cell lines was readily detected.</p><p>So far there has been only a limited number of diseases which have been associated with primary isolated or multiple defect of the TCAC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].
