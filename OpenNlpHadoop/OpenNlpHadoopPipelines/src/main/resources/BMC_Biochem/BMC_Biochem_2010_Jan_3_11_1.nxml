The regulatory mechanism involved differs from other phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mechanisms in a number of ways. Firstly, the regulatory mechanism uses ADP rather than ATP as the donor of a phosphate group. Secondly, the substrate (PPDK) for inactivation is a catalytically-phosphorylated form of the enzyme substrate. Thirdly, the activation reaction involves a phosphate-dependent phosphorolytic removal of the regulatory phosphate group rather than a simple phosphatase-catalysed dephosphorylation reaction. And fourthly, both the inactivation and activation activities are catalyzed by a single enzyme (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] for a review). The PDRP from maize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and Arabidopsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] have recently been cloned and expressed and their homology to the DUF299 gene family recognised.</p><p>A phylogenetic analysis of the DUF299 amino acid sequences available in GenBank segregated the DUF299 proteins into two major clades representing those bacterial species that possess PPDK and those that possess phosphoenolpyruvate synthetase (PEPS; EC 2.7.9.2) (see Results and Discussion below).

The formation of an EP form of the enzyme either in the presence of ATP or PEP was subsequently reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and a histidine residue identified as the site of phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>The successful expression of the maize PDRP (DUF299) and the close similarity of the amino acid sequence of bacterial DUF299 prompted an investigation of the role of the DUF299 from <italic>E. coli</italic>.

Modifications to standard expression and extraction protocols were required to maximize the production of soluble, stable forms of both enzymes. PEPS expression was optimised by initially growing cells at 37&#x000b0;C for 3 h and pre-cooling cultures to 25&#x000b0;C prior to isopropyl thiogalactoside (IPTG) induction of protein synthesis. In addition, dithiothreitol (DTT), to a final concentration of 10 mM, and glycerol, to a final concentration of 20% (v/v), was required to be added to the purified protein to retain active, soluble protein. The purified protein was stable for several days at room temperature or for more than 6 months at -80&#x000b0;C. Cold stored enzyme needed to be reactivated by incubation at room temperature for at least 20 min.</p><p>For PSRP, cultures had to be cooled to 18&#x000b0;C prior to induction of protein synthesis at 18&#x000b0;C, and glycerol had to be included in all solutions used during the purification of the protein, to maintain the enzyme in a soluble form.

There was no evidence to suggest that the N-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-tag of pROEX, which included the amino acid sequence MSYYHHHHHHDYDIPTTENLYFQGA, affected PSRP activity in any way.</p></sec><sec><title>Inactivation and activation activities of the expressed <italic>E. coli </italic>PSRP</title><p>The purified PSRP catalysed both the ADP/ATP-dependent inactivation (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) and the P<sub>i</sub>-dependent activation of purified <italic>E. coli </italic>PEPS (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). In addition, the expressed PSRP catalysed in-assay activation. In-assay activation occurs when inactivated PEPS in aliquots taken from a separate inactivation reaction activates in the assay used to measure PEPS activity. Addition of P<sub>i </sub>to reaction mixtures used to measure PEPS activity in aliquots taken from inactivation reactions resulted in an increasing rate of PEPS activity; in the absence of added P<sub>i </sub>PEPS activity remained linear. Therefore it was significantly easier to measure PEPS inactivation compared to measuring maize PPDK regulation due to the fact that there was no in-assay activation if P<sub>i </sub>was omitted from reactions measuring PEPS activity. Therefore, in contrast to measuring maize PDRP activity, there was no need to add Blue Dextran or Cibacron blue to inhibit in-assay activation when inactivation activities of <italic>E. coli </italic>PEPS were measured.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>ADP/ATP-dependent inactivation of bacterially-expressed <italic>E. coli </italic>PEPS by bacterially-expressed <italic>E. coli </italic>PSRP.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Reaction mixtures</th><th align="left">PEPS activity at zero time (%)</th><th align="left">PEPS activity after 5 min (%)</th><th align="left">PEPS activity after 10 min (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Complete</td><td align="center">100</td><td align="center">16</td><td align="center">4</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Minus ADP/ATP</td><td align="center">100</td><td align="center">98</td><td align="center">103</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Minus PSRP</td><td align="center">100</td><td align="center">97</td><td align="center">98</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Minus PEPS</td><td align="center">0</td><td align="center">0</td><td align="center">0</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Complete plus 5 mM pyruvate</td><td align="center">100</td><td align="center">95</td><td align="center">94</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>PEPS inactivation was measured as described in Materials and methods.

Only about 40% of the PEPS was inactivated which suggested that less than 50% of the PEPS was catalytically phosphorylated during pre-incubation with PEP.

This is in contrast to one of the two Arabidopsis PDRP isozymes that have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], one of which catalyses both the inactivation and activation reactions while the second isozyme catalyzes only the inactivation reaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Substrate specificity of <italic>E. coli </italic>PSRP and maize leaf PDRP</title><p>Experiments were conducted in which <italic>E. coli </italic>PSRP was replaced with bacterially-expressed maize PDRP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]; no ADP/ATP-dependent inactivation of <italic>E. coli </italic>PEPS was detected (results not shown). Furthermore, no ADP/ATP-dependent inactivation was detected in reciprocal experiments in which <italic>E. coli </italic>PEPS was replaced with maize PPDK.</p><p>The fact that <italic>E. coli </italic>PEPS activity is regulated by PSRP may be important in light of experiments in which potato plants were transformed with an active <italic>E. coli </italic>PEPS in an attempt to increase the photosynthetic CO<sub>2 </sub>assimilation rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]; no increases in photosynthetic CO<sub>2 </sub>assimilation rates were detected. <italic>E. coli </italic>PEPS was introduced into potato (a C<sub>3 </sub>plant) in attempts to introduce an operating C<sub>4 </sub>photosynthetic pathway under the belief that the bacterial enzyme was not regulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>The regulation of <italic>E. coli </italic>PEPS by AMP, ADP, oxaloacetate, &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate, malate, ADP-glucose and 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The results presented in this paper provide evidence for the existence of another level of regulation of PEPS activity. The PSRP-dependent regulatory mechanism may be critical in controlling the metabolic direction of pyruvate in the cell, either towards the oxidative catabolism of pyruvate via the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex to produce more ATP, or the anabolic conversion of pyruvate to PEP and glucose via an active PEPS. The results in this paper indicate that the PSRP-dependent regulation of PEPS in <italic>E. coli </italic>is affected by the concentration of three major compounds (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>); ADP, ATP and pyruvate. This regulation is similar to the PDRP-dependent regulation of PPDK in maize. In maize, ADP is both a substrate for the inactivation of PPDK and an inhibitor of the P<sub>i</sub>- dependent activation of inactivated PPDK. In contrast, ATP is not only a substrate for PPDK but, together with pyruvate, controls the rates of ADP-dependent inactivation of PEPS by controlling the phosphorylation status of the catalytic histidine residue; ADP-dependent inactivation of PEPS requires the catalytic histidine residue to be phosphorylated. The pyruvate-dependent inhibition of ADP-dependent inactivation of PEPS is consistent with <italic>E. coli </italic>PEPS needing to be catalytically phosphorylated prior to inactivation. Therefore when <italic>E. coli </italic>is grown on pyruvate or lactate as a sole carbon source, the metabolic fate of pyruvate will be controlled by the relative activities of pyruvate dehydrogenase and PEPS. Under elevated intracellular ADP concentrations ADP would not only inhibit PEPS activity but also inactivate PEPS while the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex would be active. In contrast, at low ADP concentrations, which would also indicate high ATP concentrations, PEPS would be activated and the E1 component of the PDH complex inhibited which would favour the anabolic conversion of pyruvate to PEP; PEP would be available for the shikimic acid pathway in addition to conversion to glucose.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Scheme for the regulation of <italic>E. coli </italic>PEPS by ADP, pyruvate and ATP</bold>.

In maize, the form of inactivated PPDK that is not phosphorylated on the catalytic histidine residue is the preferred substrate for Pi-dependent activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>The synthesis of PEP via PEPS is important in the biosynthesis of many commercially important chemicals; PEP is a precursor for shikimic acid synthesis that, in turn, is the starting material for the production of a wide range of products including Tamiflu, an orally effective anti-influenza agent (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]). <italic>E. coli</italic>, over-expressing PEPS, are widely used in the biosynthesis of shikimic acid as is over-expression of 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonic acid 7-phosphate (DAHP) synthase whose use can be limited by feedback inhibition. Over-expression of feedback insensitive DAHP synthase isozymes have been used in microbial syntheses of commercially important products such as aromatic amino acids, phenylalanine and tryptophan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The discovery of the existence of a phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mechanism that regulates PEPS activity may have to be taken into account if PEPS and PSRP are expressed in cells used for the synthesis of compounds dependent on the shikimic acid pathway. And in much the same way that feedback inhibition insensitive DAHP synthase isozymes are used in microbial based syntheses, PEPS may need to be altered to render the enzyme insensitive to PSRP-dependent regulation and maintain it in its active form. The effect of altering the regulatory threonine residue close to the catalytic histidine residue in PEPS is currently under study.</p><p>The wide distribution of DUF299 in bacteria, the proximity of the <italic>duf299 </italic>gene to <italic>ppdk </italic>and <italic>pps </italic>genes in bacterial genomes, the expression of <italic>E. coli </italic>PEPS and DUF299 and the demonstration that <italic>E. coli </italic>PEPS is subject to both ADP-dependent inactivation and P<sub>i</sub>-dependent activation, indicate that the function of the gene family identified as DUF299 is to control either PEPS or PPDK activities.

All assays were conducted at 25&#x000b0;C in a Beckman DU650 spectrophotometer. Reactions mixtures contained 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 8 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM DTT, 10 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 2 mM pyruvate, 1 mM glucose-6-phosphate, 1 mM ATP, and 2 mM NADH, 2 units of maize leaf PEPC and 2 units of malate dehydrogenase.

Inactivation reactions were initiated by the addition of ADP/ATP and 20 &#x003bc;L aliquots removed at different time intervals and the PEPS activity measured as described above.</p><p>To measure PEPS activation, PEPS was first inactivated by incubation of PEPS with purified PSRP, ADP and ATP as described for an inactivation reaction for 20 minutes in which time &#x0003e;95% of the PEPS was inactivated. The entire inactivation reaction was desalted on a Sephadex G25 column (0.5 mm &#x000d7; 10 mm) equilibrated with column buffer, and 250 &#x003bc;L of column eluate collected after the void volume was discarded. Aliquots (50 &#x003bc;L) of Sephadex G25 column eluate were added to an equal volume of column buffer and activation initiated by the addition of P<sub>i </sub>(to a final concentration of 1 mM). Aliquots (20 &#x003bc;L) were removed and assayed for PEPS activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Isolation of inactivated PEPS</title><p>A scaled up inactivation assay was run in which 0.2 mL of PEPS (15 units.mL<sup>-1</sup>) was inactivated in the presence of 0.2 mL purified <italic>E. coli </italic>PSRP and 20 mM ADP/1 mM ATP in a total volume of 0.5 mL and PEPS inactivated for 30 min. Less that 2.5% of the initial activity remained after the 30 min incubation. The entire inactivation reaction mixture was loaded onto a 5 mL column of Agarose-Blue dextran (Sigma-Aldrich) and the column washed with PEPS Column buffer. The PSRP bound to the column while the PEPS passed through the column and was separated from the ADP/ATP by gel filtration. The protein concentration of eluate was monitored at 280 nm and the protein peak collected and used as the supply of inactive PEPS in activation assays. The successful removal of PSRP was confirmed by adding a 50 &#x003bc;L aliquot of the peak protein fraction to a 1 mL PEPS assay mix and adding phosphate to a final concentration of 1 mM in the assay.</p></sec><sec><title>Catalytic phosphorylation of PEPS by PEP</title><p>In experiments in which the PEPS was catalytically phosphorylated in the presence of PEP, 2 units of PEPS in PEPS Column buffer was incubated with 5 mM PEP for 20 mins at room temperature and the PEP removed from the PEPS by Sephadex G25 column chromatography.</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of the native molecular weight of PSRP</title><p>A 0.5 mL sample of the fraction with the highest ADP-dependent PEPS inactivation activity eluted from the nickel-NTA column was loaded onto a column (1.5 cm &#x000d7; 60.0 cm) of Sephacryl-S200 equilibrated with PSRP Column buffer and 2.0 mL fractions collected at a flow rate of 0.5 mL.min<sup>-1</sup>.
