As a relatively unstable posttranslational protein modification it is difficult to quantify the degree to which any particular protein is modified by Cys-SOH within a complex biological environment.

Under variant biochemical circumstances it may serve to mediate redox signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], fundamentally alter protein activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], or absorb and deflect oxidative insults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Much of this evidence has only recently come to light because the unstable, transient nature of Cys-SOH has prevented its thorough study in decades past: As a protein modification it is generally unstable unless enveloped within a stabilizing protein microenvironment.</p><p>The ability to quantify the extent to which individual proteins are modified by Cys-SOH in complex biological matrices is an important step in understanding the full range of biological processes in which the posttranslational modification plays a role. Naturally, complex biological samples represent the ultimate context for such relative-percent-abundance (RPA) determinations of protein Cys-SOH. But a combined lack of spectral absorption properties and chemical instability have historically left few options available with regard to analyzing protein Cys-SOH in even the simplest matrix. Covalent trapping with a sulfenic acid-specific probe that changes an intrinsic property (e.g., mass or optical absorbance characteristics) of labeled protein molecules is, currently, the only viable path of routine detection. To date, the most commonly used chemical traps of Cys-SOH are molecules with dimedone or sulfhydryl functional groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. These have been employed successfully and are quite useful in the analysis of isolated proteins; the former have even been applied to detecting the presence of protein Cys-SOH in biological samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. But the molecular complexity of biological samples imparts a layer of analytical difficulty that has yet to be overcome with regard to determining the precise degree to which specifically targeted proteins are modified by Cys-SOH in their native environments. Thus, beyond simple (positive or negative) detection of Cys-SOH within specific proteins or the relative quantification of Cys-SOH in many proteins together in bulk, little has been developed in the way of technologies to quantify the precise degree to which particular proteins within complex biological samples are modified by Cys-SOH.</p><p>Herein we report on the application of mass spectrometric immunoassay (MSIA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] to the detection and relative quantification of Cys-SOH as it modifies specifically targeted proteins in human plasma. MSIA is high throughput affinity chromatography, followed by the analysis of intact proteins by mass spectrometry, using relative mass spectral peak intensities corresponding to modified and unmodified protein forms as representative of their relative abundances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. This is a well established analytical procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] and is analogous to an ultra-high resolution, semiquantitative western blot. In addition to the now well known example of albumin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] we report on the RPA of previously undocumented Cys-SOH formation in transthyretin (TTR) as it occurs within the biological matrix of human plasma. Taken altogether, however, our results also compel the description of several analytical precautions related to trapping, detecting, and quantifying Cys-SOH in complex biological samples.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><p><italic>Detection and Relative Quantification of Cys-SOH Formation within Specific Plasma Proteins</italic>: The strategy taken was to trap Cys-SOH, then extract and analyze all molecular forms of targeted proteins using MSIA. Albumin and TTR serve as ideal model proteins by which to assess this strategy because each possesses a single free cysteine residue--meaning that only one mole of Cys-SOH can form per mole of protein.</p><p>Albumin and TTR were immunoaffinity-extracted from human plasma that was treated with hydrogen peroxide and the dimedone-based Cys-SOH trapping reagent 5-[2-(3-chlorophenoxy)phenyl]-4-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)-1,3-cyclohexanedione (CPPCHD; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Dimedone itself and other dimedone-based probes such as DCP-Bio1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] produce qualitatively analogous results. The high mass of dimedone-based probes such as CPPCHD and DCP-Bio1 provides a significant mass shift to the protein such that tagged protein molecules lie out of the mass range of commonly observed posttranslationally modified protein variants. For example, S-cysteinylation (&#x00394;m +119 Da) and S-Cysteinylglycinylation (&#x00394;m +176 Da) are frequently observed as posttranslationally modified forms of free cysteine-containing proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]).

By comparing the RPA of Cys-SOH modified albumin detected following plasma preparation by dilution vs. immunoaffinity extraction, it can be determined whether or not antibodies bind dimedone-tagged forms of the proteins with different affinity than that with which they bind naturally occurring form(s). (By the term "dimedone-tagged" we refer to molecules that bear a 1,3-cyclohexanedione (dimedone-like) functional group.)</p><p>To begin to assess the accuracy and precision of the technique for determining the RPA of Cys-SOH modified proteins, a series of experiments were run in which human plasma was exposed to increasing concentrations of hydrogen peroxide to generate abundant quantities of Cys-SOH. Plots of the RPA of dimedone-tagged target protein vs. hydrogen peroxide concentration (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) reveal two potential problems. First, by comparing the RPA (y-axis) of tagged albumin when analyzed by dilution vs. MSIA (for both dimedone-based probes; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, Panels A and B), a quantitative discrepancy is readily apparent in which the MSIA-based technique reports a lower RPA of covalently tagged albumin than the dilution technique. The most likely explanation for this phenomenon is that there is a diminished binding affinity of the anti-albumin antibodies for tagged forms of the protein. Second, by comparing the RPA of Cys-SOH modified albumin reported by the two different dimedone-based probes across a series of hydrogen peroxide concentrations (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, Panel A vs. B, solid squares), a substantial quantitative discrepancy is readily apparent: DCP-Bio1 was present in solution at a higher concentration than CPPCHD but results in lower apparent values for RPA of Cys-SOH. This is most likely due to differences in reaction rates between the two probes for the Cys-SOH site. This brings up the question of which, if either probe reports a truly accurate (surrogate) quantitative value for the RPA of Cys-SOH originally present in the plasma.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Relative percent abundance (RPA) of cysteine sulfenic acid on albumin (solid markers) as reported by the A) CPPCHD and B) DCP-Bio1 Cys-SOH probes over a range of plasma concentrations of hydrogen peroxide</bold>. As shown for albumin, there is a significant difference in the percent of modified protein detected when samples are prepared by dilution vs. MSIA. This demonstrates relative antibody aversion for CPPCHD and DCP-Bio1-tagged forms of albumin. Additionally, the RPA values for cysteine sulfenic acid-modified albumin appear significantly lower when trapped by (higher concentrations of) DCP-Bio1--demonstrating an empirical discrepancy in Cys-SOH trapping efficiency between the two dimedone-based probes. Plasma from the same individual was used for collection of these datasets. Data on the RPA of dimedone-tagged TTR (hollow markers) are shown for reference. RPA values decrease at the highest concentrations of hydrogen peroxide due to overoxidation of Cys-SH to cysteine sulfinic acid (SO<sub>2</sub>H). Evidence to support this assertion can be seen as a +32 Da mass shift from the Cys-SH form (and only the Cys-SH form) of the hydrogen peroxide treated samples in <bold>Figure 1, panel B</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2091-11-25-2"/></fig><p>The final calculated concentrations of CPPCHD and DCP-Bio1 in solution were 9 mM and 17 mM, respectively. However it is possible that these final concentrations may not have actually been reached due to solubility issues: CPPCHD has a calculated (ALOGpS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]) aqueous solubility of about 25 &#x003bc;M and DCP-Bio1 of about 120 &#x003bc;M. However, the existence of 5-10% DMSO in solution coupled with evidence from others that DCP-Bio1 shows increased rates of alkylation of pure protein with increasing concentrations of DCP-Bio1 up to about 1 mM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], leads to the final conclusion that both probes were saturated in solution and that the concentration of DCP-Bio1 was higher than that of CPPCHD.</p><p>But even at saturating concentrations, the rates of reaction of dimedone-based probes with Cys-SOH are slow enough that, in a complex biological fluid like human plasma, resulting reports of Cys-SOH RPA stand to be in error because of the presence of endogenous free small molecule thiols such as cysteine, homocysteine, and glutathione which react much faster with protein Cys-SOH than dimedone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The concentration of <italic>free </italic>cysteine in human plasma is typically in the 1-10 &#x003bc;M range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], if not more [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Experimentally, evidence for the competitive reaction of endogenous free cysteine with protein Cys-SOH can readily be seen vis-&#x000e0;-vis an increase in the intensity of the peaks representing S-cysteinylated albumin and TTR in samples to which hydrogen peroxide was added to generate Cys-SOH (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). This is a fundamental limitation of dimedone-based probes of protein Cys-SOH.</p><p>By nature no surrogate trapping technique can guarantee a quantitatively perfect representation of a trapped molecular species--particularly when the species to be trapped are molecularly unstable and there is endogenous competition for reaction with them. This suggests that, other factors held equal, the trapping reagent with the fastest reaction rate toward the unstable target molecule will provide the most quantitatively accurate estimate of the unstable species.</p><sec><title>Assessment of 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoic acid as a Quantitative Probe</title><p>2-nitro-5-thiobenzoic acid (a.k.a., thionitrobenzoic acid or TNB) is the disulfide-reduced form of Ellman's reagent which is classically used for the determination of free thiol groups in proteins. Recently, Turell et al determined that the rate constant for TNB reaction with albumin Cys-SOH is 105 M<sup>-1 </sup>s<sup>-1</sup>--over 3000 times greater than that for unsubstituted dimedone and 5 times greater than that for free cysteine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Thiols do not spontaneously react with other thiols in the absence of an oxidizing agent and, under the conditions employed, TNB does not readily participate in intramolecular disulfide exchange by reducing/inserting itself into the existing disulfide bonds of albumin. When this is the case, neither reduced thiols nor disulfides interfere with TNB as a probe of Cys-SOH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Under the conditions used for the experiments described below, no albumin modified by two or more molecules of TNB was detected. This serves as experimental verification that TNB was not reacting with protein disulfide bonds. (Though not applicable to these studies, however, it is possible for protein-TNB mixed disulfides to be removed by intramolecular disulfide exchange wherein a molecule of TNB is released and a disulfide bond is formed between two cysteine residues that normally interact with one another as part of normal protein operation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>].)</p><p>To assess the utility of TNB as a quantitative probe for the RPA of Cys-SOH-modified albumin and transthyretin in human plasma, TNB was added to plasma at increasing concentrations immediately after the plasma was exposed to 4 mM hydrogen peroxide (for 2 minutes) then catalase. As described below, <italic>immediate </italic>protein purification and analysis (i.e., <italic>zero </italic>explicit TNB incubation time) was found to be necessary to minimize artifactual formation of Di-TNB (Ellman's reagent/DTNB) and subsequent labeling of free cysteine residues. As such, it was also important to minimize the concentration of TNB added to plasma samples. At concentrations beyond 250 &#x003bc;M the addition of TNB did not result in additional labeling of protein Cys-SOH (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>); thus this concentration of TNB was employed in subsequent experiments.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Relative percent abundance (RPA) of cysteine sulfenic acid on albumin (solid markers) and TTR (hollow markers) as reported by increasing concentrations of TNB</bold>.

Interestingly, based on its spontaneous reactivity with TNB in the absence of exogenous hydrogen peroxide (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> Panel B, - H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/+ TNB trace), a significant proportion of TTR protein molecules appear to possess native Cys-SOH. This finding is not due to artifactual non-covalent association of TNB with TTR.

For both albumin and TTR there was no statistically significant difference in the RPA of TNB-modified protein when samples were prepared by dilution vs. immunoaffinity extraction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Though, for TTR, a t-test p-value of just over 0.06 suggests that there may indeed be a slight antibody bias against TNB-labeled protein molecules.

These values have not previously been reported for TTR because the existence of Cys-SOH modified TTR was unknown.

Notably, these values may well vary depending on the percentage of albumin molecules carrying a free cysteine residue.

As such, when employed as a trap of Cys-SOH without precaution to prevent such homodimer formation, erroneously high values for relative percent Cys-SOH abundance may be obtained.</p><p>To quantitatively determine the extent of this effect at 250 &#x003bc;M TNB, a fresh solution of TNB was prepared in a 25 mM bicarbonate buffer containing 0.15 M NaCl (pH 7.4) and monitored for loss of absorbance at 412 nm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] over 15 minutes--a time period longer than that required to immediately pass TNB-exposed plasma through a gel filtration spin column (removing &#x0003e; 95% of the TNB), dilute or immunoaffinity extract, and introduce the resulting sample into a mass spectrometer. (The molar absorptivity at 412 nm for DTNB is 211 M<sup>-1 </sup>cm<sup>-1 </sup>and that for TNB is 14,150 M<sup>-1 </sup>cm<sup>-1 </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>].) Decay was limited to a loss of 0.5 &#x003bc;M/min, corresponding to a potential <italic>maximum </italic>DTNB formation rate of 0.25 &#x003bc;M/min. Conservative (i.e., overly abundant) incubations of 1-10 &#x003bc;M DTNB in plasma for 25 minutes showed that this rate of formation of DTNB from TNB results in no detectable (i.e., less than ~ 1% relative abundance) formation of TNB-modified albumin and only trace/marginally detectable quantities of TNB-modified TTR. But given that, in our experiments, freshly reduced TNB was employed (see Methods section) and &#x0003e;95% of TNB was filtered out of our samples within seconds via centrifugal gel filtration, it is reasonable to assert that artifactual formation of DTNB and its subsequent contribution to our measured RPA values of TNB-modified protein was negligible.</p></sec><sec><title>Advantages and Disadvantages of Cys-SOH Relative Quantification by Mass Spectrometric Analysis of Intact Proteins</title><p>When coupled with a rapid purification technique, mass spectral analysis of intact proteins provides a degree of molecular detail and an ability to analyze proteins in complex biological matrices that is essentially impossible to match with other available techniques such as spectrophotometry or western blotting.

However, considering the overall size of proteins and the sheer number of charges on each protein molecule (+8 to +19 for TTR and +30 to +66 for albumin) coupled with the at-most &#x000b1; 1 charge-unit effect of a single differential substituent on whole protein ionization, the argument for an effect of ionization efficiency on apparent molar abundances becomes negligible.</p></sec><sec><title>Physiological Relevance</title><p>With few exceptions, most studies of protein-SOH described in the literature involve induction of protein-SOH using non-physiological concentrations of exogenous oxidants such as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Because the addition of exogenous oxidants to create protein-SOH is required for most proteins, the RPAs of protein-SOH observed in this and other studies reported in the literature are certainly higher than might be found physiologically. However, this study, as well as others, clearly shows that mixed protein-glutathione and protein-cysteine disulfides exist naturally in significant quantities. Based on the observations reported in this study, we hypothesize that a major physiological role of protein-SOH (for the vast majority of proteins) is to serve as an oxidative intermediate in the formation of reversible mixed protein disulfides. As such, the <italic>in vivo </italic>RPA of protein-SOH in most proteins at any given instant in time will likely be low.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Molecular probes which covalently trap Cys-SOH can yield modified proteins that are less well-recognized by antibodies than their unmodified/natural counterparts. Each combination of protein, probe, and antibody stands to differ in this effect and must be investigated empirically. Dimedone-based probes of Cys-SOH are useful for detecting the presence of protein-specific Cys-SOH within complex biological matrices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], but with regard to relative quantification, their reaction rates with Cys-SOH may be outpaced by reactions with endogenous thiols. TNB reacts faster with Cys-SOH than endogenous thiols or dimedone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]; we have shown herein that when proper precautions are taken to ensure its stability, TNB's fast reaction rate, limited antibody bias, and net mass shift make it useful in the relative quantification of Cys-SOH on specific proteins within human plasma when mass spectrometry is employed for detection. Transthyretin in its native environment appears to be modified by Cys-SOH in the absence of exogenous oxidants. Amongst different individuals, free cysteine-containing plasma proteins can vary widely in the fraction of protein molecules carrying free thiol groups. Thus ultimately, to understand and properly interpret the relative quantification of protein modification by Cys-SOH, it is necessary to be aware of this percentage of target protein molecules that contain free thiol groups and thus are available for modification by Cys-SOH.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>Human plasma from a single healthy female donor and a single healthy male donor was purchased from ProMedDx.
