KYNA is the only known endogenous antagonist of the <italic>N</italic>-methyl-D-aspartate subtype of glutamate receptors[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. It is also an antagonist of the &#x003b1;7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In addition, KYNA is identified as an endogenous ligand for an orphan G-protein-coupled receptor (GPR35) that is predominantly expressed in immune cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Abnormal concentration of KYNA in cerebrospinal fluid/brain tissue has been observed in patients with mental and neurological disorders, including the Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis and others (for a review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]). These data suggest that KYNA, acting as an endogenous modulator of glutamatergic and cholinergic neurotransmission, may be functionally significant in the development and progression of these diseases. In addition to its roles as an excitatory amino acid and &#x003b1;7-nicotinic acetylcholine antagonist, KYNA is also involved in the control of the cardiovascular function by acting at the rostral ventrolateral medulla of the central nervous system (CNS)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Spontaneously hypertensive rat, the most widely used animal model for studying genetic hypertension, is associated with abnormally low KYNA levels in the area of CNS which controls physiological blood pressure[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>KYNA is produced enzymatically by irreversible transamination of kynurenine, the key intermediate in the tryptophan catabolic pathway. In humans, rats and mice, four proteins arbitrarily named KAT I, II, III and IV, have been considered to be involved in KYNA synthesis in the CNS[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. KAT I is identical to glutamine transaminase K (GTK) and cysteine conjugate beta-lyase (CCBL) 1; KAT II is identical to aminoadipate aminotransferase (AADAT); KAT III is identical to CCBL 2; and KAT IV is identical to glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) 2 and mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT). Although the involvement of these enzymes in brain KYNA production has been discussed, their specific roles in brain KYNA synthesis remain to be established.</p><p>Among the individual mammalian KATs, KAT I and KAT III share similar genomic structure and high sequence identity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and therefore likely have overlapped biological functions. An increase in KAT I and KAT III expression was observed in kat-2 <sup>-/- </sup>mice brain, suggesting that KAT I and KAT III expression compensated for the loss of KAT II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. This also might explain why phenotypes such as the hyperactivity and abnormal motor coordination in the kat-2 <sup>-/- </sup>mice were rescued[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].

The biochemical function and structural characteristics of mouse KAT (mKAT) III have been determined[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]; and there have been a number of studies concerning the biochemical characterization of KAT IV[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. In this study, we functionally expressed mKAT I, II, III, and IV in the same expression system, purified their recombinant proteins, investigated their pH optima, temperature preferences, and identified specific inhibitors for each individual mKAT. These properties of mKATs I, II, III, and IV will help develop specific assays for the four enzymes, which could be used to identify which KAT is affected in mouse disease models."</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Biophysical properties of mKATs</title><p>SDS-PAGE analysis showed single band for each recombinant protein (not shown).

In this study, we showed mKAT IV has high transamination activity towards glutamate and aspartate, and detectable activity towards phenylalanine, tyrosine, cysteine, tryptophan, 3-HK, methionine, kynurenine, and asparagine. KAT IV was considered as a major player for the formation of KYNA in mouse, rat and human brains[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Our results certainly show that mouse brain protein extract has high mKAT IV activity as evidenced by the strong aspartate inhibition of the KYNA formation in the reaction mixture. High KAT activity is detected in mouse brain crude proteins using &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate as a co-substrate at neutral pH condition, and as mKAT IV is majorly responsible for this KAT activity, its contribution in brain KYNA synthesis has yet to be excluded. A gene knock-out study in animal models could address this question definitively.</p><p>KYNA is a metabolite in the kynurenine pathway, a major pathway in tryptophan metabolism, and its formation from tryptophan is a complicated process involving a number of enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. The overall process leading to the formation of KYNA includes oxidation of tryptophan to formylkynurenine catalyzed by tryptophan 2,3 dioxygenase and indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase; hydrolysis of formylkynurenine to kynurenine catalyzed by kynurenine formamidase; and transamination of kynurenine to KYNA catalyzed by four KATs. Alternatively, kynurenine could be oxidized by kynurenine 3-monooxygenase to form 3-HK or hydrolyzed by kynureninase to form anthranilic acid. The mouse brain crude extract not only consists of four KAT enzymes but also other proteins involved in the kynurenine pathway. In our preliminary studies, when we tested KAT activity at pH 7.5, we observed the formation of 3-HK and anthranilic acid [confirmed using standard compounds (not shown)]; we also noticed that KYNA formation was increased by adding tryptophan to the reaction mixture. This is perhaps because indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase and tryptophan 2,3 dioxygenase oxidize tryptophan at the start of the kynurenine pathway, increasing the kynurenine concentration, which, in turn, results in increased KYNA formation. Since kynurenine 3-monooxygenase oxidizes kynurenine to 3-HK and kynureninase hydrolyzes kynurenine to anthranilic acid, they may compete with the mKATs for the same substrate, kynurenine, thus interfering with the KAT activity assay. The brain crude extract sample also contains amino acids and &#x003b1;-keto acids, which are substrates or inhibitors of four mKATs; NADH and NADPH, which are cofactors of kynurenine 3-monooxygenase; and hemin, which functions as a cofacor of both indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase and tryptophan 2,3 dioxygenase. The presence of these substances and other kynurenine pathway enzymes could directly affect KAT activity assay by providing a co-substrate for KAT enzymes or by competitively inhibiting the enzymes; or they could indirectly change KAT activity by enhancing the activity of kynureninase or kynurenine 3-monooxygenase which competitively use kynurenine. To prevent or decrease the interference from other kynurenine pathway enzymes and brain chemicals, we first dialyzed the brain crude sample with a 10 kDa molecular weight cutoff membrane to eliminate possible substrates and inhibitors of four KAT enzymes, and cofactors of other kynurenine pathway enzymes from the sample. Herein, we demonstrated all mKAT I, III, IV showed high resistance to heat treatment, and mKAT II also showed noticeable activity at 60&#x000b0;C. The T<sub>m </sub>value of mKAT II is similar to that of other mKATs except that its activity declines at 60&#x000b0;C, which is lower than the T<sub>m </sub>value. One possible reason may be that the cofactor binding or dimer interaction is disrupted at 60&#x000b0;C, without changing the absorbance at 280 nm significantly. Spectral changes in 280 nm caused by protein denaturation are attributed to changes in the environment of tyrosyl and tryptophyl side chains, which are buried in the hydrophobic region of the native protein molecule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. So the contribution of this spectral change is made mainly by the disruption of secondary and tertiary structures. The damage of quaternary structure may not significantly contribute to this change unless there are enough tyrosine and tryptophan residues involved in dimerization. Comparing the crystal structures of the four mKATs will help elucidate the mechanism. CD spectroscopy of mouse indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase indicated that the T<sub>m </sub>value is 60&#x000b0;C, with a second intermediate T<sub>m </sub>at 44&#x000b0;C[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], and that rabbit indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase was not stable at 55&#x000b0;C[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Mosquito kynurenine 3-monooxygenase shows very little activity at 55&#x000b0;C[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], but there is little information about the thermal stability of mammalian kynurenine 3-monooxygenases. Here, we did notice that 3-HK formation is almost undetectable in the reaction mixture at pH 7.5 after dialysis and heat treatment of brain crude extract at 60&#x000b0;C for 15 min (not shown). Apparently, kynurenine 3-monooxygenase was deactivated either by taking away a cofactor or by destroying the secondary, tertiary or quaternary structure with heat treatment. Mammalian kynureninase has been studied for its substrate specificity, pH optimum and inhibition[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], but there is little information about its thermal stability. The heat treatment of the crude extract at 60&#x000b0;C for 15 min did decrease the anthranilic acid production catalyzed by kynureninase (data not shown). However, further study of the biochemical and biophysical properties of mouse kynureninase, indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase, tryptophan 2,3 dioxygenase, and kynurenine 3-monooxygenase is needed in order to avoid the interferences with the KAT specific assays from these kynurenine pathway enzymes.</p><p>The purpose of comparing four different mKATs is to find their unique characteristics and to develop a sensitive and specific method to assay each mKAT. The assay previously reported for KAT I using pyruvate as a co-substrate at pH 9.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] would also detect activity of the other three KATs, because they all can use pyruvate as an amino group acceptor and have activity at this pH[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In addition, pyruvate is not a favored co-substrate of KAT I. The commonly used KAT II assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] is also problematic because under the same assay conditions, KAT I and III have detectable activity and KAT IV has high activity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. mKAT enzymes might not have exactly the same properties as their human homologues, which have been characterized previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], we used the same protein expression system to produce all four mKATs and obtained pH profiles, temperature preferences and enzyme inhibitions for each individual enzyme. Some of the results are interesting, e.g. optimum pH of mKAT II (pH 6-8) is different from that of human KAT II (pH 7-9) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The characteristics of each mKAT, which could be used for developing specific assays of four mKAT enzymes are summarized for clarity in table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. Based on this information, we did preliminary tests to develop a specific assay of each KAT. The assays for mKAT I and mKAT II were shown to be highly specific; and the assay methods for mKAT III and IV were shown to be specific (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Major differences of four mKAT enzymes</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th align="left">mKAT I</th><th align="left">mKAT II</th><th align="left">mKAT III</th><th align="left">mKAT IV</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">T<sub>m </sub>(&#x000b0;C)</td><td align="left">69.8</td><td align="left">65.9</td><td align="left">64.8</td><td align="left">66.5</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">t<sub>1/2 </sub>(min)</td><td align="left">69.7</td><td align="left">27.4</td><td align="left">3.9</td><td align="left">6.5</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">pKa</td><td align="left">7.6</td><td align="left">5.7</td><td align="left">8.7</td><td align="left">6.9</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">pH optima</td><td align="left">9</td><td align="left">7-8</td><td align="left">9</td><td align="left">8</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Specific<break/>co-substrate</td><td align="left">&#x003b1;-ketobutyrate</td><td align="left">&#x003b1;-ketoglutarate</td><td align="left">&#x003b1;-ketobutyrate</td><td align="left">&#x003b1;-ketoglutarate</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Inhibitor</td><td align="left">Indole-3-propionic acid</td><td/><td align="left">methionine</td><td align="left">aspartate</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>T<sub>m</sub>: T<italic>he midpoint </italic>temperature <italic>of the protein melting</italic>; t<sub>1/2</sub>: half life value at 65&#x000b0;C</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This is the first kinetic characterization of the temperature and pH effects of the four mKAT enzymes.

The soluble fusion proteins were applied to a column packed with chitin beads and subsequently hydrolyzed under reducing conditions. The affinity purification resulted in the isolation of each individual KAT at around 80% purity. Further purifications of the recombinant KATs were achieved by DEAE-Sepharose, Mono-Q and gel-filtration chromatography. The purified recombinant KATs were concentrated to 10 mg ml<sup>-1 </sup>protein in 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 40 &#x003bc;M PLP and 10 mM &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol using a Centricon YM-50 concentrator (Millipore).

Briefly, a reaction mixture of 100 &#x003bc;L, containing 5 mM L-kynurenine, 2 mM &#x003b1;-ketoacids (&#x003b1;-ketoglutarate for mKAT II and IV, glyoxylate for mKAT I and III), 40 &#x003bc;M PLP, and 5 &#x003bc;g of recombinant protein, was prepared using 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5).

The supernatant of the reaction mixture, obtained by centrifugation at 15,000 <italic><bold>g </bold></italic>for 10 min at room temperature, was analyzed for the product, KYNA, by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with ultraviolet detection at 330 nm.</p></sec><sec><title>Substrate specificity of mKAT IV</title><p>The transamination activity of mKAT IV to other amino acids was tested using an assay mixture containing 10 mM of an amino acid, 10 mM &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate (or 10 mM oxaloacetate for the activity assay of glutamate), 40 &#x003bc;M PLP, 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and 5 &#x003bc;g enzyme in a total volume of 100 &#x003bc;l. The mixture was incubated for 15 min at 38&#x000b0;C and stopped by adding an equal amount of absolute ethanol. The product was quantitated based on the detection of o-phthaldialdehyde thiol (OPT)-amino acid product conjugate by HPLC with electrochemical detection after their corresponding reaction mixtures were derivatized by OPT reagent[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of pH and temperature on recombinant mKAT enzymes</title><p>To determine the effect of buffer pH on the activity of the four mKATs, a buffer mixture consisting of 100 mM phosphate and 100 mM boric acid was prepared and the pH of the buffer was adjusted to 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0 and 11.0. The substrates and PLP were used in the same concentrations as described above for the specific activity assay. pKa and pKb values of two proteins were calculated based on the data of specific activities versus pH values using SigmaPlot Enzyme Kinetics Module (SPSS, San Jose, CA). To determine the effect of temperature on the four mKAT enzymes, the typical reaction mixture in 100 &#x003bc;L of phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) was incubated at temperatures ranging from 20 - 80&#x000b0;C for 15 min. During the mixture preparations, enzymes were held at same temperature for 5 min.</p><p>In T<sub>m </sub>value tests, enzymes were diluted in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. Each mKAT was then heated at various temperatures for 5 min using a thermal cycler (MJ Research, Waltham, MA). The absorbance at 280 nm was detected using a UV-Visible spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). The T<sub>m </sub>value for each enzyme was calculated by fitting the equation to the recorded data using the standard curve analysis function in SigmaPlot Enzyme Kinetics Module (SPSS, San Jose, CA).</p><p>The thermal stability was determined by studying thermal inactivation of enzyme incubated in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, at 65&#x000b0;C using a thermal cycler (MJ Research, Waltham, MA).

All experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University and met or exceeded requirements of the Public Health Service/National Institutes of Health and the Animal Welfare Act. The animals were housed in groups of four to five per cage, in a room with controlled light/dark cycle (12 h light/12 h dark), and were given free access to laboratory chow and tap water. Two females and two males were sacrificed; the brains were immediately removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The brains were ground in liquid nitrogen, and the powder was transferred into 10 ml of 5 mM Tris-acetate buffer containing 40 &#x003bc;M PLP and 10 mM &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol (extract buffer) at pH 8.0, and mixed well. The mixture was centrifuged at 20,000 g, 4&#x000b0;C, for 20 min. The supernatant was collected and dialyzed overnight at 4&#x000b0;C against the protein extract buffer with a 10 kDa molecular weight cutoff membrane. The dialyzed brain crude protein extract was used for KAT activity assay. The crude protein concentration was tested by a protein assay kit from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. We used 20 &#x003bc;g brain crude protein in 100 &#x003bc;l of the same typical reaction mixture as was used in the recombinant protein KAT activity assay. The mixture was incubated at 38&#x000b0;C for 2 h. Since the amount of KYNA formed by the brain crude extract in reaction mixture is quite low compared to that formed by the recombinant protein, measurement of KYNA was performed by HPLC with fluorometric detection according to the method described by Baran and Kepplinger[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. The fluorescence detector was set at an excitation wavelength of 340 nm and an emission wavelength of 398 nm. The substrate specificity for &#x003b1;-keto acids and the inhibition of different amino acids of the brain crude extract were also tested. The inhibition was tested at both pH 7.5 (100 mM phosphate buffer) and pH 9 (100 mM sodium borate buffer).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>3-HK: 3-hydroxy-DL-kynurenine; AADAT: aminoadipate aminotransferase; ASAT: aspartate aminotransferase; CCBL: cysteine conjugate beta-lyase; GTK: glutamine transaminase K; GOT: glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase; KAT: kynurenine aminotransferase; mKAT: mouse kynurenine aminotransferase; KYNA: kynurenic acid; PLP: pyridoxal-5'-phosphate.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>QH participated in the design of the study, carried out the experiment, performed analysis and wrote the manuscript.
