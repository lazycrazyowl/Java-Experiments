Telomeres distinguish natural chromosome ends from DNA breaks. When telomere function is lost, cells arrest and undergo senescence or apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Normal DNA replication causes telomere shortening, which is counterbalanced by the extension activity of telomerase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The majority of cancers have telomerase activity, and this activity is needed for ongoing division of tumor cells. In somatic cells, telomerase activity is absent or low. When cell division occurs faster than the ability of telomerase to elongate telomeres, the short telomeres limit cell replicative capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. This limited cell division underlies diseases of tissue renewal such as dyskeratosis congenita, aplastic anemia, and pulmonary fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Thus, telomere length regulation plays a pivotal role in cancer and in age-related degenerative disease.</p><p>Both telomeric DNA structure and telomerase play a role in establishing telomere length and end protection. Telomeres have a G-rich 3'-overhang that was first discovered in ciliates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and is a conserved feature of telomeres in all eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. This 3'-overhang is the binding site for essential telomere proteins, such as Cdc13 in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>and Pot1 in mammals and other species. Loss of the overhangs due to disruption of the telomere complex, termed shelterin, leads to telomere-induced DNA damage response and chromosome end-to-end fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In addition to maintenance of DNA ends, the 3'-overhang is essential for telomerase accessibility. Telomerase recognizes and elongates single-stranded DNA substrates, but not double-stranded substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Thus, the processing of blunt ends, generated by replication, is needed for telomerase to elongate telomeres. <italic>In vivo</italic>, blocking 3'-overhang formation in <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>blocks the ability of telomerase to elongate a telomere seed sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>3'-overhang formation is an active process. In <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>and mice, generation of the 3'-overhang occurs in the absence of telomerase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>, a conditional telomerase protein component (TERT) knockout cell line showed that telomerase depletion had relatively little effects on absolute G overhang length, indicating C-strand degradation, not telomerase elongation of the G-rich strand, must generate the overhang structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Inhibition of Cdk1 blocks C-rich strand resection, thereby inhibiting 3'-overhang production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. These data suggest that there is a nuclease regulated by Cdk1 that processes the telomeres prior to elongation by telomerase. Additional evidence for an active processing enzyme comes from the fact that both ends of a chromosome have similar overhang structures. Replication of a chromosome to the very end is predicted to generate one chromosome end with a 3'-overhang and one with a blunt end [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. However, chromosomes in ciliates as well as in yeast and mammals have 3'-overhangs on both ends, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], implying at least one end must be processed to generate the overhang structure.</p><p>Finally, the very precise structure of the telomere overhangs implies that it is formed by a regulated process. The length and sequence of the 3'-overhangs in <italic>Oxytricha </italic>and <italic>Tetrahymena </italic>are surprisingly homogeneous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In <italic>Oxytricha</italic>, there is a precise overhang of two 8 nucleotide 5'-TTTTGGGG-3' repeats, whereas in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>, the overhangs are either 14-15 or 20-21 nucleotides in length, and the majority of 5'-strands end in 3'-CCAACC-5', or 3'-CAACCC-5' [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In mammals, this overhang length is also conserved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. This functional and structural evidence argues for the existence of a sequence-specific nuclease that processes telomeres. To investigate the role of 3'-overhang processing, we set out to identify a telomere-specific nuclease activity. We chose <italic>Tetrahymena </italic>to look for processing activity because it has uniform telomere repeat sequence, a precise 3'-overhang structure, and a history as an excellent biochemical source for telomere-processing factors. Here we describe a sequence-dependent 5' to 3' exonuclease activity from <italic>Tetrahymena </italic>that processes the C-strand of telomere substrates <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>To identify an overhang-processing nuclease, we assayed cell extracts from <italic>Tetrahymena </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. We designed specific duplex oligonucleotide substrates to detect a telomere-specific nuclease activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The duplex oligonucleotide substrate contains specific non-telomeric sequences with a biotin moiety that binds to streptavidin to block non-specific degradation from one end (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>, supplementary Figure S1 and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, compare <italic>lanes 2 to 3 </italic>and <italic>lanes 5 to 6</italic>). On the other end, the substrates contained either telomere repeats (5'-GGGGTT-3') or non-telomeric sequence. We tested substrates that were either blunt-ended, or with a 5'- or a 3'-overhang. To distinguish size changes of the substrates on each strand, we labeled each strand of the substrate separately in order to monitor processing occurred on the corresponding strand (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Design of oligonucleotide substrates and detection of a telomere-processing nuclease activity</bold>.

We observed a nuclease activity that degraded the telomeric substrate to a greater degree than the non-telomeric substrate (compare <italic>lanes 3 </italic>to <italic>6</italic>). This activity was robust, strand-specific, and sequence-dependent. The nuclease cleaved the 5'-strand of a blunt-ended substrate containing telomere repeats.</p><p>To further characterize this nuclease activity, we performed biochemical purification. Extracts were precipitated with ammonium sulfate, and then enriched on several fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) columns in the following order: Phenyl Sepharose, Affi-Gel Blue Gel (AGB), Mono-Q, Gel Filtration-Superdex 200, and Hydroxyapatite (HAP) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). The final active fractions were concentrated by a Mono-Q or a Q-spin column. The activity of the fractions from each step of the purification was analyzed, and the purification was monitored by Bradford protein assay and SDS-PAGE (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>, supplementary Figure S2). The final Q concentration step showed that the nuclease activity was highly enriched in three fractions (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>, supplementary Figure S2B, <italic>lanes 4-6</italic>). The active fraction contained low amount of protein, which could only be visualized on a silver-stained gel (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>, supplementary Figure S2A, <italic>lane 5</italic>). The gel filtration step of the purification indicated the active nuclease was approximately 100 kDa in size (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>).</p><p>After obtaining highly-active fractions, we characterized the specificity of the enzyme; both enzyme titration and time-course assays showed significant preference for telomeric over non-telomeric substrates (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). The telomere repeat-containing substrates were efficiently processed by the nuclease (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref><italic>, lanes 7-12 </italic>and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref><italic>, lanes 19-24</italic>) throughout the incubation time while the non-telomeric and 5'-strand labeled substrates were only minimally degraded (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>,<italic> lanes 1-6 </italic>and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref><italic>, lanes 7-12</italic>). Cleavage was specific to telomeric 5'-strands: the substrates that were labeled on the 3'-strand showed no degradation by the nuclease (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>,<italic> lanes 1-6 and 13-18</italic>). Thus, processing of the blunt substrates by this nuclease leads to 3'-overhang formation.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Enzyme titration and time course of purified telomere-specific nuclease that is a DNase</bold>.

The nuclease cleaved the telomeric DNA substrates in a DNA/DNA homoduplex (<italic>lanes 7-9</italic>), but showed a lower level of cleavage activity on the telomeric DNA/RNA in a heteroduplex structure where the C strand was the DNA strand (<italic>lanes 10-12</italic>). No cleavage activity was observed when the C strand was made of RNA in either RNA/RNA or RNA/DNA duplexes (<italic>lanes 13-24</italic>).

Exonuclease activity removes a mononucleotide from free DNA ends while an endonuclease removes oligonucleotide at each cleavage event [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. To examine the type of degradation this nuclease exhibits, we used end-labeled substrates rather than the internally-labeled substrates described above (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). With these end-labeled phosphorylated substrates, we observed cleavage on both non-telomeric and telomeric substrates (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, <italic>lanes 2-3 </italic>and <italic>5-6</italic>), and the cleavage product was mononucleotide. The decreased specificity for telomere repeats was due to the addition of the phosphate on the 5' strand as described in detail below. Because the first nucleotides on the non-telomeric and telomeric substrates were different, the mononucleotide products exhibited different mobility on a gel. This data suggested that <italic>Tetrahymena </italic>nuclease is an exonuclease.</p><p>To further examine the potential exonuclease activity of the <italic>Tetrahymena </italic>enzyme, we used oligonucleotides with specific bonds containing phosphorothioate linkage modification. This modification blocks cleavage activity of nucleases. We first tested the internally-labeled substrates that each contained one to several adjacent phosphorothioate linkages at positions 1-3, 5-11, 6-7, 7-8, and 8-9 (counting from the 5' terminus of the substrate) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). While the unmodified non-telomeric and telomeric substrates behaved as expected, we saw complete blockage of nuclease activity when there were phosphorothioate linkages at position 1-3 (<italic>lanes 5-6</italic>). When phosphorothioate linkages were placed at more internal positions, we saw significant cleavage that did not extend as far into the DNA as the unmodified substrates, indicating cleavage only occurred up to the blockage sites (<italic>lanes 7-14</italic>). To further examine the exonuclease activity, we synthesized substrates with individual bonds blocked with phosphorothioate modification and labeled at the 5'-end (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). We tested these 5'-labeled substrates with the <italic>Tetrahymena </italic>nuclease. Blockage between nucleotide positions 1-2 significantly reduced the cleavage by the nuclease (<italic>lanes 5-6</italic>) whereas terminal cleavage still occurred on all other substrates (<italic>lanes 7-20</italic>). We concluded that the <italic>Tetrahymena </italic>nuclease activity we isolated is an exonuclease.</p><p>When using end-labeled substrates, we also detected a band that appeared to be larger than a mononucleotide (indicated by an arrow, Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). While the position of this band first suggested that it might be an endonucleolytic cleavage product, it was blocked by the phosphorothioate at the 1-2 position. We tried to map the size of this product, but its mobility varied depending on the acrylamide concentration, and it did not line up with either 3'-phosphate or 5'-phosphate marker ladders (data not shown). We conclude that this may be a modified nucleotide given that its generation is blocked by the terminal phosphorothioate linkage.</p></sec><sec><title>The <italic>Tetrahymena </italic>nuclease only cleaves specific permutations of the 5'-telomeric C-rich strand</title><p>To further examine the sequence specificity of the exonuclease activity, we examined all the permutations of the <italic>Tetrahymena </italic>6-nucleotide telomeric repeat sequence. Surprisingly, there was significantly more cleavage of telomeric substrates with sequences ending in 5'-AA or 5'-CA while other permutations were not cleaved (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). We also tested telomeric repeat sequences from human (5'-AACCCT-3') and yeast (5'-AC<sub>1-3</sub>-3') and observed cleavage on both of these substrates (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>).

Many exonucleases have been biochemically characterized and have been grouped based on their processing polarity, domain similarity, and substrate specificity, such as structure-specific 5' nucleases, 3'-5' exonucleases, metallo-beta-lactamase family, and single-stranded-specific nucleases (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]). None of these exonucleases that have been previously characterized show sequences specificity. Thus, we sought to characterize the sequence specificity of this <italic>Tetrahymena </italic>exonuclease in detail.</p><p>Since our nuclease is an exonuclease, to examine the sequence specificity, we compared the activity of the <italic>Tetrahymena </italic>exonuclease to the activity of the well-characterized Exo1 that has been implicated in telomere processing. Exo1 has a strong preference for cleavage of DNA with a 5'-phosphate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Thus, we first compared the cleavage of 5'-phosphorylated and unphosphorylated substrates with the purified <italic>Tetrahymena </italic>nuclease (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated telomeric substrates were cleaved to a similar extent by the <italic>Tetrahymena </italic>nuclease (compare <italic>lanes 8 </italic>to <italic>4</italic>). There was also an increase in cleavage activity on the 5'-phosphorylated, non-telomeric substrate. While this non-telomeric cleavage on 5'-phosphorylated substrate was less extensive than cleavage on the telomeric substrate, this data implies a reduced specificity for telomeric substrates on 5'-phosphorylated DNA. We next utilized human Exo1 in cleavage assays to compare the biochemical properties of our <italic>Tetrahymena </italic>nuclease. For convenience, whenever Exo1 activity is mentioned in this study, it refers to human Exo1. Enzyme titration of Exo1 with phosphorylated substrates showed that it robustly cleaves DNA from 5'-end into the substrate up to the internal labeling site, releasing the internally labeled nucleotide that runs at the bottom of the gel (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>).

As an exonuclease, Exo1 prefers 5'-recessed structures, and as an endonuclease, it cleaves flapped structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Because of these structural preferences for Exo1, we tested the specificities of these two nucleases with substrates that had different end structures (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). We designed telomeric, and non-telomeric substrates ending in either 5'-CGAA or 5'-AATG that were either blunt, or had a 3'- or 5'-overhang. Using non-phosphorylated substrates, all of the telomeric substrates were actively cleaved by the <italic>Tetrahymena </italic>nuclease (<italic>lanes 12, 15 </italic>and<italic> 18</italic>). The Exo1 digestions showed a preference for substrates that contained a 3' overhang (<italic>lanes 5</italic>, <italic>14</italic> and <italic>23</italic>) as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. We also examined the activities of both enzymes on phosphorylated substrates and found similar results, although the level of Exo1 cleavage was higher (data not shown). Since there was no preference for the different structures tested with the <italic>Tetrahymena </italic>exonuclease, we concluded that this enzyme does not show the structure-dependent activity of Exo1.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Tetrahymena </italic>exonuclease shows end-nucleotide specificity</title><p>Because the <italic>Tetrahymena </italic>exonuclease showed a preference for AA and CA terminal nucleotides on nonphosphorylated telomeric substrates (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>), we next ask whether end-sequence specificity is preserved in the presence of 5'-phosphorylated substrates. We examined the six different permutations of the telomere repeat using both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated telomeric substrates. The <italic>Tetrahymena </italic>nuclease showed sequence preference for AA and CA ending substrates (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>, supplementary Figure S3), while Exo1 did not show significant sequence specificity.</p><p>We next tested a series of non-telomeric substrates with all possible permutations of the 5'-terminal two nucleotides (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). The substrates were all internally-labeled. When testing unphosphorylated substrates (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>), there was some cleavage of all substrates, except when G was the terminal nucleotide. There was a clear preference for substrates ending with an A residue. The order of cleavage preference for the terminal nucleotide was A&#x0003e;T&#x0003e;C&#x0003e;G (<italic>lanes 1-3 </italic>and <italic>7-51</italic>). However, the cleavage pattern on these non-telomeric substrates was limited to terminal nucleotides compared to the more extensive cleavage of the telomeric substrate (compare <italic>lanes 4-6 </italic>to <italic>22-24</italic>). This difference in the extent of cleavage may be due to the specific nucleotide that is exposed next or may be influenced by contacts with internal nucleotides in the telomere repeats. The possibility of contacts with internal nucleotides could also explain the low cleavage observed on yeast repeat sequences ending in 5'-AC when compared to the <italic>Tetrahymena </italic>repeat permutation ending in 5'-AC (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Incubation of the <italic>Tetrahymena </italic>exonuclease with the same set of sequences that were 5'-phosphorylated showed a similar trend of sequence specificity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). Exo1 was tested along side the <italic>Tetrahymena </italic>exonuclease, and it cleaved all phosphorylated substrates well. However, Exo1 did not show any specificity for the terminal nucleotide sequences (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>), note the similar intensity of the mononucleotide band in every 3<sup>rd </sup>lane on the gel. Unphosphorylated substrates were also cleaved by Exo1 without any sequence preferences, except that the level of cleavage was lower (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). Together, this data suggests that unlike Exo1, which is a structure-specific nuclease, the <italic>Tetrahymena </italic>nuclease is a sequence-dependent exonuclease.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Enriched <italic>Tetrahymena </italic>nuclease shows sequence-dependant cleavage</bold>.

This 3'-overhang is a ubiquitous structure of eukaryotic telomeres, and is essential for telomere end protection and for elongation by telomerase. The <italic>Tetrahymena </italic>nuclease we described is a 100 kDa enzyme that shows preference for cleaving AA- or CA-ending residues that are present in the C-strand of telomeric repeats.</p><p>The existence of a telomere-specific nuclease has been postulated for years. A number of nucleases including Mre11, Sae2, Dna2, Artemis, Apollo, Werner syndrome protein (WRN), and Exo1 have been examined for their role in different aspects of telomere processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Mre11 and WRN are both 3'-5' nucleases that have been found associated with telomeres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. While the directionality of Mre11 and WRN is not consistent with 5'-strand resection at the telomere, recent biochemical studies of WRN show a sequence-specific cleavage on telomeric 3'-overhang [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], suggesting WRN may pay a role in processing the G-rich overhang strand.</p><p>Sae2, Artemis, Apollo, and Dna2 are 5' nucleases, but none of these nucleases show biochemical specificity for either blunt-ended or telomeric substrates. Apollo, interacts with the telomere-binding protein, TRF2, and cleaves single-stranded DNA but shows no sequence preferences <italic>in vitro </italic>between telomeric repeats and unique sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Recent studies have showed that Apollo is recruited by TRF2 and plays a role in processing leading-strand overhangs in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>], and human Apollo cooperates with TRF2 to help resolve topological stress during telomere replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. Sae2 is an endonuclease with substrate specificity on 3' overhangs, hairpins, and branched DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>], and it processes hairpin structures and meiotic double-strand breaks together with MRX/N complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. Dna2 is a multi-functional enzyme that possesses helicase and single-stranded DNA specific endonuclease activities. In <italic>S. pombe</italic>, Dna2 was implicated in telomere 3'-overhang generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], but <italic>in vitro</italic>, Dna2 shows no sequence specificity for cleavage of single-stranded DNA (Kao &#x00026; Bambara, unpublished results). These differences in biological specificity indicate that the <italic>Tetrahymena </italic>exonuclease is not the same enzyme as any of these known 5'-3' nucleases.</p><p>Because our enzyme has a 5'-3' exonuclease activity, we compared its biochemical properties with Exo1. Exo1 is a well-characterized 5'-3' nuclease that plays a role in multiple DNA metabolic pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], including telomere maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>]. <italic>In vivo </italic>evidence suggests that Exo1 contributes to telomere maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] and may participate in the generation of ssDNA at dysfunctional telomeres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]. Studies have also shown that Exo1 is important in processing ends for the recombination pathways that allow survivors to grow in the absence of telomerase in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. The biochemical specificity we report for the <italic>Tetrahymena </italic>exonuclease is different from the properties of Exo1. The <italic>Tetrahymena </italic>nuclease has specificity for telomere repeats ending in 5'-AA and 5'-CA, but Exo 1 did not show sequence specificity. In addition, Exo1 shows much higher activity on phosphorylated substrates ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>], Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>, supplementary Figure S3) while the <italic>Tetrahymena </italic>exonuclease has significant activity on both unphosphorylated and phosphorylated substrates. These differences in specificity indicate that the <italic>Tetrahymena </italic>exonuclease that we purified is distinct from Exo1.</p><p>Several lines of evidence indicate that C-strand processing is regulated; the precise structure of 3'-overhangs in ciliates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], the cell cycle-specific generation of 3'-overhangs in yeast, and the formation of overhangs in the absence of telomerase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. This regulation occurs through both Cdk1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and through telomere-specific binding proteins. Telomere end-binding proteins, such as TEBP &#x003b1;&#x003b2; heterodimer, first discovered in <italic>Oxytricha </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>], bind to single-stranded telomeric DNA through an OB fold and protect the telomeres from degradation, recombination, and end-joining [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>]. In yeast, Cdc13 binds to the single-stranded overhang, and together with Stn1 and Ten1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>] protect the ends and play a role in end-processing and telomere elongation. In mammalian cells, Pot1, a component of the shelterin complex, binds the single-stranded overhang through an OB fold domain similar to the TEBP &#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>]. Pot1 also plays a role along with other shelterin complex components in regulating access of processing nucleases to telomeres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>]. Thus, the specific action of telomere processing nucleases on telomeres will involve interaction with these telomere-specific binding proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Telomere structure and function is conserved throughout eukaryotes. Telomerase is present in most eukaryotes and is essential for telomere elongation. The negative feedback mechanism in which telomere-binding proteins inhibit elongation of long telomeres and allow the establishment of a telomere length equilibrium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>] is also conserved from yeast to mammals. While the sequence of telomere-binding proteins in different organisms differ, the function of these proteins in end protection and regulation of telomere elongation is highly conserved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>]. Given this conservation, we think it is likely that telomere processing is also conserved. While there are likely multiple factors involved in telomere processing, the sequence-specific properties of the <italic>Tetrahymena </italic>exonuclease described here suggest it may play a role in telomere processing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title><italic>Tetrahymena </italic>extracts</title><p>Both mated and unmated cell extracts were tested, and nuclease activity was found in both.

Proteins were eluted at a gradient of TMG-1.7 M (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>to TMG-0 M. Nuclease activity was detected in TMG 400 mM ~ 500 mM (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. The positive fractions were pooled, dialyzed, and then loaded onto an Affi-Gel Blue Gel column (Bio-Rad, CA). The proteins were eluted in a gradient from TMG-0M KCl to TMG-1M KCl, and nuclease activity was detected in TMG 200 mM ~ 400 mM KCl fractions. The positive fractions were combined, dialyzed, and loaded onto a Mono-Q column (GE Healthcare, Amersham Biosciences, NJ). The proteins were eluted with a TMG-0M KCl to TMG-1M KCl gradient, and active fractions eluted at TMG 250 mM KCl ~ 400 mM KCl. The nuclease activity positive fractions were combined, concentrated with a Q spin column (Viva Science, Germany), and loaded onto a Superdex 200 (GE Healthcare, Amersham Biosciences, NJ) gel filtration column with TMG-100 mM KCl buffer. A gel filtration standard (Bio-Rad, CA) was used to estimate the MW of the nuclease. Kav was calculated by the following equation: Kav = (Ve-Vo)/(Vt-Vo), where Kav is a constant that is between 0-1, Ve is elution volume for the protein, Vo is column void volume (typically, 30% of the total column volume), and Vt is total bed volume. Kav was then plotted against Log MW of the standard, which was used to determine the MW of the nuclease. The nuclease ran at approximately 100 KDa (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Active fractions were combined and loaded onto a hydroxyapatite, HAP, column (Bio-Rad, CA). The column was eluted with a gradient from TMG-0M to TMG-250 mM potassium phosphate, and the active fractions were found at 15 ~ 60 mM potassium phosphate. ~ 2,500 fold enriched nuclease preparation was obtained, and the active and purified fractions were combined, dialyzed, and concentrated using a Mono-Q or Q spin column.</p></sec><sec><title>Oligonucleotide substrates</title><p>The oligonucleotide sequences utilized in this report are listed in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>, supplementary Table S1.
