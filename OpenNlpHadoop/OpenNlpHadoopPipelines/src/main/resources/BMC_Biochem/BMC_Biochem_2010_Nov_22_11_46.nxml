Although the architecture of CpFAS1 resembles those of bacterial polyketide synthases (PKSs), this megasynthase is predicted to function as a fatty acyl elongase as our earlier studies have indicated that the N-terminal loading unit (acyl-[ACP] ligase) prefers using intermediate to long chain fatty acids as substrates, and each of the three internal elongation modules contains a complete set of enzymes to produce a saturated fatty acyl chain. Although the activities of almost all domains were confirmed using recombinant proteins, that of the C-terminal reductase domain (CpFAS1-R) was yet undetermined. In fact, there were no published studies to report the kinetic features of any reductase domains in bacterial PKSs using purified recombinant or native proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In the present study, the identity of CpFAS1-R as a reductase is confirmed by in silico analysis on sequence similarity and characteristic motifs. Phylogenetic analysis based on the R-domains supports a previous notion on the bacterial origin of apicomplexan Type I FAS/PKS genes. We also developed a novel assay using fatty acyl-CoAs as substrates, and determined that CpFAS1-R could only utilize very long chain fatty acyl-CoAs as substrates (i.e., with activity on C26 &#x0003e; C24 &#x0003e; C22 &#x0003e; C20, but no activity on C18 and C16). It was capable of using both NADPH and NADH as electron donors, but prefers NADPH to NADH.

Among them, <italic>C. parvum </italic>is zoonotic and infects both humans and animals. <italic>Cryptosporidium </italic>infection in immunocompetent individuals may cause self-limiting diarrhea, but its infection in immunocompromized patients can be chronic and life-threatening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Therefore, it is an important opportunistic pathogens in AIDS patients. Additionally, there are no effective treatments against cryptosporidial infection in AIDS patients.</p><p>The <italic>Cryptosporidium </italic>genus belongs to the Phylum Apicomplexa that also contains many important human and animal parasites such as <italic>Plasmodium, Theileria, Toxoplasma, Eimeria </italic>and <italic>Cyclospora </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, <italic>Cryptosporidium </italic>is known to be evolutionarily and metabolically divergent from other apicomplexans. For example, as a group of early branch apicomplexans, <italic>Cryptosporidium </italic>lacks an apicoplast and its associated metabolic pathways (e.g., isoprenoid and Type II fatty acid synthetic pathways). It has also virtually lost the capacity to synthesize any nutrients de novo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. On the other hand, this parasite possesses a unique Type I fatty acid synthase (CpFAS1) and a putative polyketide synthase (CpPKS1) that are encoded by 25-kb and 40-kb intronless open reading frames (ORFs), respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The megasynthase CpFAS1 is defined by at least 21 enzymatic domains including a loading unit (containing a fatty acyl ligase [AL] and an acyl carrier protein [ACP]); three internal module, each containing a ketoacyl synthase [KS], an acyltransferase [AT], a dehydrase [DH], an enoyl reductase [ER], a ketoacyl reductase [KR] and an ACP; and a C-terminal acyl reductase domain (<bold>R</bold>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The AL domain loads a fatty acid to the ACP to form an acyl-ACP, in which the acyl chain may be elongated by the internal modules and finally released by the <bold>R </bold>domain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Structure of the reductase (<bold>R) </bold>domain within CpFAS1 and its catalyzed reaction</bold>. <bold>A</bold>) Illustration of the position and conserved NAD(P)H-binding and reductive motifs of the <bold>R </bold>domain within the CpFAS1 megasynthase. <bold>B) </bold>Proposed reactions catalyzed by CpFAS1 including that by the <bold>R </bold>domain.

Therefore, we have adapted a "divide and conquer" strategy and successfully expressed individual units/modules to study their biochemical features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Our previous experiments using recombinant proteins have shown that the CpFAS1 loading unit has a substrate preference to medium and long chain fatty acids (MCFAs and LCFAs), and all domains within the three internal modules are enzymatically functional, suggesting that CpFAS1 is likely involved in the elongation of saturated fatty acid(s), rather than the de novo fatty acid synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, although the C-terminal <bold>R </bold>domain was expressed, its biochemical features were yet to be determined then due to the lack of an appropriate assay.</p><p>Here we report our recently developed assay and experiments that reveal some unique biochemical features for the CpFAS1 acyl reductase domain (CpFAS1-R) including the substrate preference and kinetics for the first time for this family of acyl reductases. We have not only confirmed the reductive activity of CpFAS1-R, but also determined that it could only utilize very long chain fatty acyl thioesters as its substrates. Additionally, we have also performed phylogenetic analysis and observed bacterial-affinity of reductase domains from various apicomplexan FASs and PKSs.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Sequence features and evolutionary affiliation of the CpFAS1-R domain</title><p>Among apicomplexans, Type I FAS/PKS genes are only discovered from <italic>Cryptosporidium </italic>and cyst-forming and intestinal coccidia (eg. <italic>Toxoplasma </italic>and <italic>Eimeria</italic>), but absent in the hematozoa that contain only Type II FAS (eg. <italic>Plasmodium </italic>and <italic>Babesia</italic>) or no FAS at all (eg. <italic>Theileria</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Both <italic>Cryptosporidium </italic>and <italic>Toxoplasma </italic>genomes contain reductase domains at the C-terminal ends of the Type I FAS and PKS, respectively. The <italic>E. tenella </italic>genome is only partially sequenced (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/E_tenella/">http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/E_tenella/</ext-link>), from which only one reductase domain could be recovered. The architectures of CpFAS1 and CpPKS1 resemble bacterial and fungal PKS rather than the Type I FAS in humans and animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Additionally, these parasite megasynthases appear to use acyl reductase domains to release the fatty acyl or polyketide chains as "long chain" alcohols, rather than using thioesterase (TE) to produce acids (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). However, none of the apicomplexan genomes encodes any non-ribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS) that may act alone or together with PKSs to produce complex products.</p><p>Like most acyl reductase domains of the type I PKS and NRPS proteins, CpFAS1-R is located at the C-terminus and is defined by approximately 780 amino acids (aa) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The first half of the domain contains conserved sequences and motifs characteristic to acyl reductase domains of PKSs and NRPSs, and to the fungal L-aminoadipate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (AASDH), which include the Rossmann-fold NAD(P)H binding site "Gx<sub>1-2</sub>GxxG" and a reduction motif "GYxxSKWxxE" (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. However, the C-terminal half of the domain appears to be unique to the apicomplexans, as it is only homologous to the other apicomplexan FAS1 and PKS1 <bold>R </bold>domains, but not to any other species in the databases, nor does it contain any putative motifs.</p><p>Sequence comparisons indicated that the CpFAS1-R domain was more closely related to those of bacterial or fungal PKS/NRPS proteins. When CpFAS1-R domain was used as a query to search animal protein databases, there were no hits from vertebrate sequences. The only hits with significantly high identities are three invertebrate proteins annotated as oxidoreductase family or hypothetical proteins, i.e., <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic>, (XP_002121624, E-value = 2.E-25), <italic>Brugia malayi </italic>(XP_001899674, 9.E-25), and <italic>Trichoplax adhaerens </italic>(XP_002112422, 8.E-15). Other invertebrate hits with much lower identities were a number of acyl-CoA reductases, mainly from insects such as <italic>Drosophila mojavensis </italic>(XP_002000602, 4.E-10) and <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus </italic>(XP_001847721, 1.E-9). This is in contrast to the hits from bacterial and fungal proteins, in which &#x0003e;420 and &#x0003e;170 hits displayed E-values at or smaller than 9.E-10 and 9.E-20, respectively.</p><p>Phylogenetic reconstructions inferred from various bacterial and fungal reductases or <bold>R </bold>domains by Bayesian inference (BI) method clearly separated fungal AASDH from PKS/NRPS, in which major nodes were moderately to highly supported by the posterior probability (PP) values (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Although fungal and bacterial PKS/NRPS formed several individual clusters, they were generally intermixed, possibly suggesting multiple origins of fungal PKS/NRPS genes. It is noticeable that putative oxidoreductases from two invertebrates (i.e., <italic>Brugia malayi </italic>and <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic>) formed as a sister clade of &#x003b3;-proteobacterial NRPS (<italic>Francisella philomiragia</italic>) (see branches colored in purple in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), suggesting a possible horizontal transfer of PKS/NRPS-like genes from prokaryotes to certain eukaryotes.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Phylogenetic relationship of apicomplexan FAS/PKS reductase domains with orthologous sequences from bacterial and fungal PKS/NRPS, and fungal AASDH proteins as inferred by Bayesian inference (BI) method using a <italic>WAG </italic>+ <italic>F</italic></bold><sub><bold>inv </bold></sub><bold>+ <italic>&#x00393;</italic><sub>(12) </sub>model</bold>.

This group is then clustered together with several bacterial PKS/NRPS reductases. However, the CpPKS1-R domain alone was unexpectedly placed within another bacterial PKS/NRPS cluster. Although this observation is of some implication that CpFAS1 and CpPKS1 (or their R domains) might have different evolutionary origins, more rigorous analyses using additional domains are needed to truly make firm conclusions. Nonetheless, these observations support a bacterial affiliation of apicomplexan FAS/PKS <bold>R </bold>domains, as previously observed for the acyl transferase (AT) domains from CpFAS1 and CpPKS1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>CpFAS1-R domain's substrate preference</title><p>The <bold>R </bold>domain-catalyzed release of final products by bacterial and fungal PKS/NRPS polypeptides were mainly determined by analyzing the products in native or heterogeneous hosts expressing engineered PKS/NRPS genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. There were several studies that directly observed the release/formation of products using recombinant PKS/NRPS modules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. However, there were no reported studies to directly assay the <bold>R </bold>domain activities and measure the kinetic parameters in vitro. On the other hand, it is impractical (if not impossible) to obtain sufficient pure <italic>Cryptosporidium </italic>materials for extensive biochemical analyses, and molecular tools are also unavailable to genetically manipulate this parasite. Therefore, heterogeneous expression systems and the use of recombinant proteins may be the only approaches currently available to study the biochemical feature of the CpFAS1 or CpPKS1 proteins and domains.</p><p>Suitable substrates are required to directly assay the <bold>R </bold>domain activity. However, there are some technical difficulties in preparing the native substrates for CpFAS1-R (i.e., very long chain fatty acyl-ACP). On the other hand, we have previously observed that the N-terminal AL domains from CpFAS1 and CpPKS1 could utilize LCFAs and CoA as substrates to form fatty acyl-CoA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], and additionally, the CpFAS1-R domain is related to the acyl-CoA reductases (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). This prompted us to test whether fatty acyl-CoAs could also be used by CpFAS1-R as substrates to assay its activity.</p><p>In this study, the recombinant CpFAS1-R was expressed and isolated into homogeneity as a maltose-binding protein (MBP)-fusion protein as previously reported (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, our first attempts using C16:0 palmitoyl-CoA as substrate and NAD(P)H as electron donors failed to detect any activity. Considering that the final CpFAS1 product(s) could be at least 6-carbons longer than the MCFAs or LCFAs loaded by the AL domain (i.e., after elongation by the three internal elongation modules) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], we extended our analysis to include a wide range of all commercially available long chain to very long chain fatty acyl-CoAs, and eventually observed activities. In fact, CpFAS-Red was active on acyl-CoAs with &#x02265;20-carbon chains, but inactive on substrates with 18 or fewer carbons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). The activities towards C20 and C22 acyl-CoAs were generally low, but well above the background, whereas activities towards C24 and C26 (the longest fatty acyl-CoA currently available) were much more apparent. Using NADPH as a cofactor, we have determined the kinetic parameters of CpFAS1-R towards C26-CoA that followed allosteric kinetics (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). The Hill slope (<bold><italic>h</italic></bold>) was 2.0, indicating a positive cooperativity between the binding of cofactor and acyl-CoA. The maximum velocity (<bold><italic>V</italic></bold><sub>max</sub>) and the substrate concentration to achieve 50% of the <bold><italic>V</italic></bold><sub>max </sub>value (<bold><italic>K</italic></bold><sub>50</sub>) were determined to be 32.8 nmol min<sup>-1 </sup>mg<sup>-1 </sup>protein and 0.91 mM, respectively. The turnover rate (<bold><italic>K</italic></bold><sub>cat</sub>) was ~4.6 min<sup>-1</sup>, indicating that CpFAS1-R could effectively transfer electrons from NADPH to this VLC fatty acyl-CoA, but at a low efficiency. CpFAS1-R could use both NADPH and NADH as cofactors, but it apparently prefers NADPH to NADH as co-assayed with C26-CoA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>SDS-PAGE analysis of recombinant CpFAS1-R domain as bacterial expressed maltose binding protein (MBP)-fusion protein before and after amylose resin-based chromatography purification as indicated on top of the gel</bold>.

Therefore, it is yet unclear whether CpFAS1-R-released products are VLC fatty aldehydes or fatty alcohols. We have repeatedly attempted, but failed to detect the CpFAS1-R-released acyl chains using thin layer chromatography (TLC) and mass spectrometry. On the other hand, TLC was able to distinguish C16 fatty alcohol and aldehyde using standards or preparations in controlled experiments (data not shown), or by other investigators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. It is possible that the limited amounts of VLC fatty acyl products were likely precipitated or aggregated after being separated from CoA to become insoluble for TLC or MS detection. However, since aldehydes are toxic to cells, and no additional VLC fatty acyl reductases are present in the <italic>Cryptosporidium </italic>genomes, we speculate that the final products produced by CpFAS1 are likely VLC fatty alcohols. Nonetheless, based on previously reported data and the present study, we are able to propose a general scheme of reactions catalyzed by the various domains of CpFAS1 as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>.</p><p>Since the giant CpFAS1 and CpPKS1 are structurally and functionally different from humans Type I FAS, these parasite megasynthases may serve as novel drug targets. CpFAS1 and CpPKS1 also utilize <bold>R </bold>domains to release final products, which differs from human FAS that uses a thioesterase (TE) to product fatty acids. This unique feature suggests that like several other enzymatic domains, the reductase domains in CpFAS1 and CpPKS1 may also be explored as drug targets. The production of recombinant CpFAS1-R protein together with the novel assay developed in this study make it possible for the screening of inhibitors for potential drug development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Sequence analysis</title><p>The CpFAS1-R domain protein sequence was used as a query to repeatedly search the NCBI genome and protein databases with various BLAST algorithms.
