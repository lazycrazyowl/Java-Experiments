Cleavage of the chromogenic trypsin substrate BApNA showed that AaET has a catalytic efficiency (k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub>) that is ~30 times higher than bovine trypsin, and ~2-3 times higher than AaSPVI and AaSPVII, however, AaLT does not cleave BApNA. To measure the enzyme activities of the mosquito midgut proteases using natural substrates, we developed a quantitative cleavage assay based on cleavage of albumin and hemoglobin proteins. These studies revealed that the recombinant AaLT enzyme was indeed catalytically active, and cleaved albumin and hemoglobin with equivalent efficiency to that of AaET, AaSPVI, and AaSPVII. Structural modeling of the AaLT and AaSPVI mature forms indicated that AaLT is most similar to serine collagenases, whereas AaSPVI appears to be a classic trypsin.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These data show that <italic>in vitro </italic>activation of recombinant serine proteases containing a heterologous enterokinase cleavage site can be used to investigate enzyme kinetics and substrate cleavage properties of biologically important mosquito proteases.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>trypsin</kwd><kwd>Aedes aegypti</kwd><kwd>hemoglobin</kwd><kwd>serum albumin</kwd><kwd>zymogen</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Female mosquitoes must acquire a blood meal from vertebrate hosts in order to obtain the proper nutrients for completion of the gonotrophic cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The site of blood meal digestion and nutrient absorption is localized in the midgut, which is also the entry site for blood-borne human pathogens. The blood feeding behavior of mosquitoes facilitates the transmission of many human pathogens, including Dengue and yellow fever viruses, and malarial parasites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Because of the resurgence in Dengue fever in tropical and subtropical regions of the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], and the global persistence of malarial parasite infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], it is critical to understand biochemical processes required for blood meal metabolism as a means to develop effective vector control strategies.</p><p>Blood feeding in the Dengue mosquito, <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, induces the release of proteolytic enzymes in the mosquito midgut, which leads to the degradation of blood meal proteins into peptides and amino acids. These blood protein-derived peptides and amino acids are required for the synthesis of lipid and carbohydrate stores, and as a source of energy for egg production. The major classes of digestive enzymes in blood fed female <italic>Ae. aegypti </italic>mosquitoes are trypsins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], chymotrypsins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], aminopeptidases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and carboxypeptidases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Based on cleavage of the trypsin substrate analog BApNA (N&#x003b1;-benzoyl-D, L-arginine p-nitroanilide), we recently showed that trypsin-like activity in midgut extracts of dsRNA-injected blood fed <italic>Ae. aegypti </italic>mosquitoes was primarily due to two serine proteases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. One is the early phase trypsin, AaET, and the other, is a late phase trypsin named AaSPVI, which is a member of the 5G1 superfamily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. RNAi based studies using BApNA assays to analyze midgut extracts for trypsin activity from 0-48 hr post blood meal (PBM) showed that AaET is the only trypsin-like protease during the first 1-6 hr PBM, whereas the AaSPVI protease accounts for up to 75% of the BApNA cleaving activity during the late phase of digestion from 12-36 hr PBM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. These same experiments also showed that another midgut protease, AaSPVII, contributed significantly to overall fecundity in blood fed mosquitoes. Interestingly, RNAi knock down of AaLT expression, also known as Late Trypsin, had no effect on BApNA activity in midgut extracts, even though it reduced fecundity by ~30% as did the AaSPVI RNAi knock downs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. These data suggest that AaSPVI, and not AaLT, is the major late phase midgut trypsin in blood fed <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, and are consistent with bioinformatic analyses of protease encoding genes in the <italic>Ae. aegypti </italic>genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Trypsin belongs to the serine protease family, which includes chymotrypsin, elastase, and serine collagenase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. During catalysis, the active site serine becomes deprotonated and functions as a nucleophile attacking the carbonyl of the peptide substrate, leading to the formation of a tetrahedral intermediate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Serine deprotonation by histidine, and stabilization of the newly protonated histidine by a nearby aspartate residue, constitutes a charge relay system consisting of the classic catalytic triad Ser-His-Asp. Structures of a large number of serine proteases have shown that they contain two six-stranded &#x003b2;-barrels and up to six disulfide linkages, which stabilizes the tertiary structure of these often secreted enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The substrate specificity of serine proteases is determined in part by an amino acid residue in the substrate specificity pocket. For example, trypsins contain an aspartate residue at this position and cleave the peptide bond on the carboxyl terminal side of arginine and lysine residues, which form an ionic interaction with the aspartate residue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In contrast, serine collagenases have less well-defined substrate specificity pockets, and hence display a wider range of preferred cleavage sites in protein substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>To better understand the biochemical properties of the AaET, AaLT, AaSPVI, and AaSPVII midgut serine proteases, we engineered a heterologous enterokinase cleavage site into the propeptide region of the recombinant proteins and optimized a protein purification protocol using a denaturation/renaturation strategy. We quantitatively measured enzyme activity in the AaET, AaLT, AaSPVI, and AaSPVII proteases using the artificial BApNA substrate, as well as the natural substrates serum albumin and hemoglobin.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Design of enterokinase cleavable forms of four midgut serine proteases</title><p>Most digestive proteases in animals are synthesized as inactive precursor proteins that are proteolytically cleaved to generate the mature enzymatically active form. To determine if this is also true of the <italic>Ae. aegypti </italic>AaSPVI, AaSPVII, and AaLT midgut proteases, we used peptide specific antibodies in Western blots of midgut extracts from blood fed mosquitoes. For these experiments, female <italic>Ae. aegypti </italic>mosquitoes were blood fed, and 18-24 hr later, midguts were removed by dissection and divided into two protein fractions, the midgut epithelium and the food bolus. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, all three proteases were found to be present in two forms, with the smaller of the two proteins corresponding to the predicted molecular weight of the enzymatically active mature form. In the case of AaSPVI, the predicted zymogen form was primarily localized to the midgut epithelium, with only the mature form found in the food bolus, whereas both the zymogen and mature forms of AaSPVII and AaLT were found in the food bolus.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Serine proteases in <italic>Ae. aegypti </italic>mosquitoes are processed to generate the mature active forms of the enzymes</bold>. A) Western blot of midgut epithelium (MgEp) and food bolus protein extracts obtained from blood fed mosquitoes at 24 hr PBM using antibodies specific for AaSPVI, AaSPVII, and AaLT as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Each lane contains protein from 0.2 midgut equivalents obtained from pooled blood fed mosquitoes. Note that it is not possible to use a protein loading control for these two extracts because the amount of protein differs by &#x0003e;5-fold (MgEp versus food bolus), and moreover, the MgEp proteins are from mosquito origin and the food bolus proteins are from bovine origin. B) Amino acid sequence of the nascent polypeptide (zymogen) for the four mosquito serine proteases (AaET, AaSPVI, AaSPVII, AaLT) and bovine trypsin (BvT). The protein leader sequence was predicted by SignalP 3.0, whereas the propeptide sequence was defined as the sequence between the leader sequence C-terminus and the N-terminus of the mature form of the proteases based on the known amino acid sequence of the BvT mature form. The predicted propeptide cleavage site is shown. C) Amino acid sequence of the Mek forms of the four recombinant mosquito proteases showing the engineered EK propeptide sequence.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2091-12-43-1"/></fig><p>As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, we used bioinformatics to predict the most likely propeptide cleavage site in the AaSPVI, AaSPVII, and AaLT proteases based on amino acid sequence alignment, which also included the early phase trypsin, AaET, and bovine trypsinogen. Using the SignalP 3.0 algorithm to detect leader sequences in the full-length proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], each of the four mosquito serine proteases was predicted to contain a leader sequence targeting the nascent polypeptide to the endoplasmic reticulum. By aligning the amino acid sequences of the four mosquito proteases with that of bovine trypsinogen using ClustalW [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], it can be seen that the most likely propeptide cleavage site is between the amino acids GR-IV (AaET, AaSPVI) or GR-VV (AaSPVII, AaLT).</p><p>We were unable to activate purified zymogen forms of these proteases <italic>in vitro</italic>, and high level bacterial expression and purification of recombinant mature forms of these four proteases failed to yield sufficient quantities of catalytically active enzymes (data not shown). Therefore, we engineered a heterologous enterokinase cleavage site (DDDDK) into an artificial propeptide region referred to as Mek, which permitted purification of inactive enzyme that could be activated <italic>in vitro </italic>using commercial preparations of enterokinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, the heterologous DDDDK enterokinase cleavage site was linked to the N-terminal sequence MNNNLG derived from pMAL-c4E, which we found to be associated with efficient Mek protein cleavage by enterokinase in an <italic>in vitro </italic>reaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Purification of recombinant mosquito midgut serine proteases in soluble form</title><p>Based on other recombinant protease purification protocols that have been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], we optimized a protein denaturation and refolding strategy to purify soluble Mek forms of the proteases following IPTG induction. We found that the pET29a vector and BL21-DE3 bacterial expression system yielded the highest amounts of AaSPVI-Mek, AaSPVII-Mek, and AaLT-Mek proteins, whereas the AaET-Mek protein was optimally expressed using the pET28a vector. Following denaturation/renaturation, the soluble Mek proteins were cleaved <italic>in vitro </italic>at 4&#x000b0;C with recombinant enterokinase to remove the propeptide (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), and then further purified using either a benzamidine column for AaSPVI (cleaved AaSPVI-Mek), an ion exchange column for AaSPVII (cleaved AaSPVII-Mek) and AaLT (cleaved AaLT-Mek), or a combination of a Ni<sup>2+</sup>-chelating column and ion exchange column for AaET (cleaved AaET-Mek).</p><p>As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, these fractionation methods led to protein preparations containing the mature form of each mosquito protease, which were ~90% pure based on SDS-PAGE analysis. Importantly, we found that degradation of the <italic>in vitro </italic>activated proteases could be minimized by incubating the enterokinase cleavage step at 4&#x000b0;C, and including 1 mM DTT in the purification buffers (with the exception of the Ni<sup>2+</sup>-chelating step). The rationale for this was based on the fact that serine proteases contain multiple disulfide bonds that must be properly formed to obtain an enzymatically active protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The DTT was removed during dialysis at 4&#x000b0;C to promote disulfide bond formation and enzyme activation.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Representative gel of purified active mature mosquito proteases and bovine trypsin used in the enzyme assays</bold>.

For these experiments, enzyme reaction rates were determined under steady state conditions at 24&#x000b0;C from linear portions of the A<sub>405 nm </sub>versus time plots using the extinction coefficient &#x02211;<sub>405 nm </sub>= 8800 M<sup>-1 </sup>cm<sup>-1 </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The absorbance data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation and statistically analyzed by unpaired Student's t-test using GraphPad Prism software. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as 1.0 &#x003bc;mol of p-nitroaniline cleaved per min per mg of protein. The results are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> where it can be seen that the specific activities of the AaET and BvT preparations were comparable, whereas the specific activities of AaSPVI and AaSPVII preparations were 5-10 times lower than AaET and BvT. As predicted from recent <italic>in vivo </italic>RNAi studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], AaLT did not cleave BApNA under any conditions, which directly demonstrates that AaLT lacks trypsin-like activity. Also listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> are the catalytic efficiencies of the enzymes (k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub>), which show that AaET is ~30 times more efficient than BvT, primarily due to a much lower K<sub>M </sub>for BApNA than bovine trypsin.

First, most proteases are present at low amounts in tissues, and therefore must be isolated as recombinant proteins, usually from bacterial sources. However, since bacterial cells maintain a reducing environment, eukaryotic serine proteases expressed in bacterial cells are often improperly folded and localized to inclusion bodies as insoluble proteins. Second, activated proteases will autodigest if not purified under inhibitory conditions, which for structural studies of serine proteases can be done using covalent modification of the active site serine with diisopropylfluorophosphate. However, to conduct enzyme kinetic analyses, the inhibition must be reversible, or if the inactive zymogen form of the enzyme is purified, it needs to be cleaved <italic>in vitro </italic>using a readily available activating enzyme. As has been done in several other studies in which recombinant serine proteases were expressed in bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], we solved both the solubility and degradation problems. This was done by using a denaturation/renaturation protocol to refold soluble proteins, and by engineering in a heterologous cleavage site into the propeptide region to control <italic>in vitro </italic>activation (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). This combined experimental approach allowed us to answer three important questions in the field of mosquito biology, 1) which kinetic parameters differentiate the four most abundant midgut serine proteases in blood fed <italic>Ae. aegypti </italic>mosquitoes?, 2) are the BApNA cleaving activities of these four enzymes similar to the activities determined by an <italic>in vitro </italic>cleaving assay using natural protein substrates, such as albumin and hemoglobin?, and 3) if the late phase AaLT serine protease is not a trypsin-like enzyme, then what is it?</p><p>Using the substrate analog BApNA, we showed that AaET is indeed a trypsin-like enzyme cleaving BApNA more efficiently (in terms of k<sub>cat </sub>and k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub>) than the three other mosquito serine proteases analyzed, including bovine trypsin (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). In addition, we demonstrated that AaSPVII is also a trypsin-like enzyme, cleaving BApNA more efficiently than AaSPVI. This is an important finding because our earlier <italic>in vivo </italic>functional studies using an RNAi strategy, suggested that AaSPVII contributed very little to the BApNA activity in midgut protein extracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Surprisingly, AaSPVI, which was shown to be responsible for ~75% of the BApNA cleaving activity in midgut extracts in these same experiments, had the lowest specific activity in our <italic>in vitro </italic>BApNA assays, owing to a low turnover rate as defined by k<sub>cat </sub>(Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). It had previously been proposed that AaLT might not be a trypsin based on the presence of a serine residue, rather than an aspartate residue, in the specificity pocket [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. We were able to directly test this prediction using purified active AaLT protein, and found that AaLT was indeed lacking BApNA cleaving activity, despite having similar rates of digestion to that of AaET and AaSPVI using BSA and Hb as substrates (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). This result is consistent with a recent bioinformatic analysis indicating that AaLT is more closely related to serine collagenases than trypsins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], since most serine collagenases do not cleave the substrate analog BApNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Structural homology modeling of AaLT was done using a 1.8&#x000c5; serine collagenase structure from heel fly that was 40% identical to AaLT at the amino acid level (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). It can be seen from this model that a serine residue sits at the bottom of the specificity pockets of AaLT (S203) and the heel fly collagenase (S189), rather than an aspartate residue as in AaSPVI (D215) and all other bona fide trypsins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. It is likely that this amino acid difference in the specificity pocket of AaLT is responsible for the lack of BApNA cleaving activity. Moreover, similar to the heel fly collagenase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], AaLT might recognize and cleave after Leu residues, rather than Arg residues, given that both enzymes contain serine residues in the specificity pocket. However, further studies are needed to test this prediction.</p><p>Why would blood fed mosquitoes secrete a collagenase-like enzyme into the midgut, considering that human blood contains very little, if any, collagen? One explanation might be that serine collagenases have been shown to be somewhat promiscuous with regard to substrate specificity, and therefore could function as garbage disposals in the digestion system, much like proteosomes do in the cytoplasm to degrade cellular proteins. This notion comes from the extensive biochemical analysis of a serine collagenase from the fiddler crab (<italic>Uca pugilator</italic>), which has a 37% sequence identity to AaLT. These studies showed that the crab enzyme is a true collagenase, however, it was also found to have trypsin-, chymotrypsin-, and elastase-like substrate specificities and cleavage activities owing to a substrate specificity pocket that accommodates different basic, polar, and hydrophobic amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. For a mosquito to have such an enzyme would be advantageous, since the mosquito must digest the blood meal fairly quickly in order to obtain the proper nutrients to fuel the gonotrophic cycle.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Serine proteases expressed in the midgut of blood fed <italic>Ae. aegypti </italic>mosquitoes are required for protein digestion and completion of the gonotrophic cycle, and could potentially be selective inhibitor targets for vector control. In order to quantitate enzyme activities in the four most abundant midgut serine proteases in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, we engineered a heterologous enterokinase cleavage site into an artificial propeptide region to permit the purification and <italic>in vitro </italic>activation of recombinant enzymes. We found that three of the four proteases (AaET, AaSPVI, AaSPVII) cleave the trypsin analog BApNA in an <italic>in vitro </italic>assay, which confirms that they are trypsin-like serine proteases, whereas a fourth enzyme, misnamed late trypsin (AaLT), does not cleave BApNA and is structurally related to serine collagenases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Chemicals and antibodies</title><p>Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (TRIS), calcium chloride, sodium chloride, guanidium hydrochloride, and DMSO were all purchased from EMD Sciences (Gibbstown, NJ), and are of reagent grade or better.

The genes of interest were then PCR-amplified using gene-specific primers (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). Recognition sequences for NdeI and HindIII restriction sites were included in the AaET, AaSPVI, and AaSPVII primers, whereas recognition sequences for NdeI and XhoI restriction sites were included in the AaLT primer, to facilitate cDNA cloning of zymogen forms into the pET28a and pET29a vectors (Novagen, Madison, WI). A second set of protease coding sequence primers (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>), which include an artificial leader sequence containing an enterokinase cleavage site (DDDDK), a start codon, and an asparagine-rich propeptide region from the bacterial expression vector pMAL-c4E (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA), were used to construct the enterokinase site containing forms of the proteases referred to as Mek. By design, the enterokinase cleaved products of the recombinant precursor proteins were identical in amino acid sequence to the predicted mature forms of these proteases based on bioinformatics.

Once collected, samples were thawed, set in a 95&#x000b0;C water bath for 3 min, and analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE (BSA reactions) and 15% SDS-PAGE (Hb reactions). All gels were stained prior to photo documenting using the ProteoSilver Plus Silver Stain kit (Sigma Aldrich) according to the manufacturer's protocol. NIH ImageJ software was used to calculate the pixel density of the protein bands and used to determine the amount of protein substrate (nM), which was then plotted as a function of time (min) to calculate the digestion rate (nM min<sup>-1</sup>). All experiments were done in triplicate and presented in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> as mean values &#x000b1; SEM.</p></sec><sec><title>Structural homology modeling of AaLT and AaSPVI</title><p>The Protein Model Portal (PMP) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.proteinmodelportal.org">http://www.proteinmodelportal.org</ext-link> developed by the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics in Basel was used to identify protein structures that are most similar to the predicted structures of AaLT and AaSPVI as described by Arnold et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].
