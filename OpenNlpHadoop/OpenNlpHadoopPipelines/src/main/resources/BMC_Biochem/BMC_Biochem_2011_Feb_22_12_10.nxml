An often applied reaction is the lipase-catalyzed transesterification of vinyl esters and alcohols resulting in the formation of acetaldehyde which is known to deactivate microbial lipases, presumably by structural changes caused by initial Schiff-base formation at solvent accessible lysine residues. Previous studies showed that several lipases were sensitive toward acetaldehyde deactivation whereas others were insensitive; however, a general explanation of the acetaldehyde-induced inactivation mechanism is missing.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Based on five microbial lipases from <italic>Candida rugosa</italic>, <italic>Rhizopus oryzae</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens </italic>and <italic>Bacillus subtilis </italic>we demonstrate that the protonation state of lysine <italic>&#x003b5;</italic>-amino groups is decisive for their sensitivity toward acetaldehyde. Analysis of the diverse modification products of <italic>Bacillus subtilis </italic>lipases in the presence of acetaldehyde revealed several stable products such as <italic>&#x003b1;,&#x003b2;</italic>-unsaturated polyenals, which result from base and/or amino acid catalyzed aldol condensation of acetaldehyde. Our studies indicate that these products induce the formation of stable Michael-adducts at solvent-accessible amino acids and thus lead to enzyme deactivation. Further, our results indicate Schiff-base formation with acetaldehyde to be involved in crosslinking of lipase molecules.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Differences in stability observed with various commercially available microbial lipases most probably result from different purification procedures carried out by the respective manufacturers. We observed that the pH of the buffer used prior to lyophilization of the enzyme sample is of utmost importance. The mechanism of acetaldehyde-induced deactivation of microbial lipases involves the generation of <italic>&#x003b1;,&#x003b2;</italic>-unsaturated polyenals from acetaldehyde which subsequently form stable Michael-adducts with the enzymes. Lyophilization of the enzymes from buffer at pH 6.0 can provide an easy and effective way to stabilize lipases toward inactivation by acetaldehyde.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Microbial lipases (triacylglycerol hydrolases, EC 3.1.1.3) belong to the <italic>&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;</italic>-hydrolase family of enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and catalyze the hydrolysis of triglycerides to glycerol and fatty acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, lipases are the most frequently used biocatalysts in organic chemistry due to its ready availability and low cost production, lack of cofactors, broad substrate specificity and high enantioselectivity as well as high stability in non-aqueous media such as ionic liquids, supercritical fluids and organic solvents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Under non-aqueous reaction conditions lipases catalyze the synthesis of esters by esterification, inter-esterification, and transesterification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Lipase catalyzed transesterifications of alcohols with esters are equilibrium reactions that need to be shifted toward the product site. Therefore, several activated esters including enol- and ethoxyvinyl esters have been tested as substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] with enol esters such as isopropenyl acetate or vinyl acetate being the most useful acyl donors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. After cleavage, the enol tautomerizes to a carbonyl compound (acetaldehyde or acetone) which can no longer serve as a substrate for the back reaction, thus rendering the system fast and irreversible and also facilitating downstream processing due to the volatility of the carbonyl product [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, the stoichiometrically generated acetaldehyde can be used in a high-throughput assay to detect transesterification activities of lipases and esterases directly in the organic phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Despite of these advantages, aldehydes are generally known to act as alkylating reagents by forming Schiff-bases in a Maillard-type reaction, in particular with enzyme lysine <italic>&#x003b5;</italic>-amino groups. Although Schiff-base formation as such is a reversible reaction, several follow-up reactions finally render this modification irreversible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Hence, acetaldehyde affects various enzymatic properties as shown for different enzymes of biotechnological significance such as lipases, 2-deoxy-D-ribose 5-phosphate aldolase (DERA), and thiamine-diphosphate dependent enzymes, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Acetaldehyde treatment of commercial lipase preparations from <italic>Candida rugosa </italic>and <italic>Galactomyces geotrichum </italic>(formerly <italic>Geotrichum candidum</italic>) resulted in reduced activity and enantioselectivity, whereas only moderate effects were observed with lipases from <italic>Pseudomonas </italic>sp. or <italic>Rhizopus oryzae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. <italic>C. rugosa </italic>lipase was stabilized by immobilization, either covalently on an epoxy-activated carrier resin or by adsorption on Celite 545 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Aldehyde-based deactivation also represents a problem in several lipase-based industrial biotransformations, e.g. in the formation of <italic>trans</italic>-2-methoxycyclohexanol and 3-(4-methoxyphenyl) glycidic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Only recently, the activity of <italic>C. rugosa </italic>lipase was significantly increased by immobilisation of the enzyme in crosslinked-enzyme aggregates (CLEAS) together with BSA as a "proteic feeder" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Further, activity has been improved by "pH-tuning" of lipases prior to their use in organic solvents, meaning that the enzyme was lyophilized from a buffer with optimal pH for biocatalysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Current hypotheses infer that the sensitivity of lipases toward acetaldehyde depends on: (1) the microbial source from which the lipase originates; (2) its molecular weight; (3) the number of lysine residues; (4) their solvent accessibility; (5) a covalent modification of lid-domain residues (for <italic>G. geotrichum </italic>and <italic>C. rugosa </italic>lipases); and (6) the pK<sub>a</sub>-values of the lysine <italic>&#x003b5;</italic>-amino groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The latter hypothesis assumed that the nucleophilicity of lysine <italic>&#x003b5;</italic>-amino groups would define their contribution to the deactivation reaction and calculated pK<sub>a</sub>-values were used to predict Schiff-base formations with lysine <italic>&#x003b5;</italic>-amino groups of higher pK<sub>a</sub>-values and thus increasing acetaldehyde sensitivity of the respective lipase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Comprehensive mutagenesis studies of 2-deoxy-D-ribose 5-phosphate aldolase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and prolipase from <italic>R. oryzae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] failed to achieve complete stabilisation against aldehyde deactivation and furthermore indicated the involvement of several different sites in these enzymes.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate that the protonation state of lysine <italic>&#x003b5;</italic>-amino groups in microbial lipases has a significant impact on their sensitivity against acetaldehyde. We also show that <italic>&#x003b1;,&#x003b2;</italic>-unsaturated polyenals derived from aldol condensation of acetaldehyde in the presence of primary amino compounds or NaOH have a major impact on the deactivation process, most probably by forming stable Michael-adducts with lysine and other side chains.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>The protonation state determines the sensitivity of lipases toward acetaldehyde</title><p>Schiff-base formation depends on the protonation state of primary amino groups, as only a deprotonated amino group (-NH<sub>2</sub>) can nucleophilically attack the acetaldehyde carbonyl group. Thus, it can be predicted that enzyme deactivation caused by Schiff-base formation should depend on the pH of the respective reaction buffer. If biotransformations are performed in organic solvents with lyophilized or immobilized enzymes, their protonation state is affected by the so-called "pH-memory effect" meaning that lyophilization traps the protonation state of a protein in solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Different commercial enzyme preparations presumably exhibit different protonation states and additionally, stabilizing additives and/or protein impurities are commonly found resulting in heterogeneities which clearly can influence the deactivation behavior of the respective biocatalyst [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Therefore, we have adjusted the protonation states of lipases from <italic>Candida rugosa </italic>(CRL), <italic>Rhizopus oryzae </italic>(ROL), <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens </italic>(PFL), and <italic>Bacillus subtilis </italic>lipases (BSL A and B) by lyophilizing them from buffers of pH 6 and pH 10, respectively, being far below or equal to the average pK<sub>a </sub>of the lysine <italic>&#x003b5;</italic>-amino groups. The freeze-dried enzymes were then treated with acetaldehyde in toluene and the residual activity was determined. We employed toluene as the solvent for our investigation because it is of significant technical importance and is frequently used in technical lipase processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. It is worth to mention that acetaldehyde-treated lipases were not treated with reducing agents such as sodium cyanoborohydride to stabilize Schiff-bases by converting them into stable secondary amines. Hence, the obtained results can be attributed solely to the formation of stable acetaldehyde-protein adducts resulting from Schiff-bases as precursors.</p><p>Three of the studied lipases, namely CRL, ROL, and PFL, were previously investigated, with regard to their acetaldehyde sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. CRL was deactivated strongly (-76%), ROL moderately (-17%), and PFL remained nearly unaffected (-2%) upon overnight incubation with acetaldehyde (0.1 M) in toluene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. All enzymes tested showed a significant decrease in activity with increasing acetaldehyde concentrations after lyophilization at pH 10, whereas no (PFL) or only a moderate (ROL and CRL) deactivation occurred in preparations lyophilized at pH 6 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). These results demonstrate that even CRL, which was previously classified as highly sensitive against acetaldehyde [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], can be stabilized by lyophilization at a pH far below the average pK<sub>a </sub>of its lysine <italic>&#x003b5;</italic>-amino groups. These results support findings of Majumder and Gupta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], who achieved stabilization of CRL. On the other hand, lipases previously described as moderately (ROL) or completely (PFL) stable against acetaldehyde [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] can be rendered sensitive by lyophilization at a pH equal to the pK<sub>a </sub>of their lysine <italic>&#x003b5;</italic>-amino groups (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1 A-C</xref>). The uniform deactivation behaviour of ROL, CRL, and PFL identifies the lipase protonation state including the ratio of NH<sub>2</sub>- to NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>- groups as key parameters for acetaldehyde sensitivity. Previous findings suggested a modification of the lid-domain covering the active site as a putative cause of deactivation in <italic>G. geotrichum </italic>and <italic>C. rugosa </italic>lipases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Thus, we compared the deactivation behaviour of BSL-A and BSL-B which share a compact minimal <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>/<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-hydrolase fold lacking a lid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. These lipases (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D+E</xref>) show the same deactivation kinetics as CRL, ROL, and PFL (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A-C</xref>) indicating that the modification of the lipase core structure dominates the deactivation behaviour. Additionally, isoelectric focusing experiments revealed a significant shift of the isoelectric point (pI) from about pH 9.5 for the untreated lipase sample toward pH 6 for the acetaldehyde treated sample (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). This result suggests that an initial Schiff-base modification may be followed by the formation of stable acetaldehyde-protein adducts. Furthermore, a prediction of the pK<sub>a</sub>-values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] of solvent accessible lysine residues for all lipases whose structures are solved and deposited in the protein data base (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pdb.org">http://www.pdb.org</ext-link>) revealed similar pK<sub>a</sub>-values in all cases, including four of five lipases studied in this work (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>, Tab. S1). Thus, it can be concluded that acetaldehyde will affect other lipases in a similar manner.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Deactivation of microbial lipases with acetaldehyde after lyophilization at pH 6 and pH 10, respectively</bold>.

Further, intramolecular cross-links may result from the reaction of lysine-bound Schiff-bases with neighbouring peptide bonds forming 4-imidazolidinone rings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Investigation of possible cross-linked products was performed using BSL-B as a model enzyme. The enzyme was incubated with different concentrations of acetaldehyde (0-0.5 M) in aqueous solution at pH 10 where BSL-B shows maximum activity and stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Analysis by SDS-PAGE revealed additional bands with higher molecular weight (~ 40 kDa and ~ 60 kDa) appearing at an acetaldehyde concentration of 0.08 M (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The intensity of these bands increased with increasing acetaldehyde concentrations indicating the formation of BSLB-dimers (~ 40 kDa) and trimers (~ 60 kDa) respectively, presumably caused by intermolecular cross-link formation. Parallel determination of the hydrolytic lipase activity and the soluble protein concentration revealed deactivation already at an acetaldehyde concentration of 0.08 M (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Increasing the acetaldehyde concentration to 0.5 M led to a complete deactivation of BSL-B, whereas considerable protein aggregation could be detected only at concentrations above 1.3 M (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Furthermore, a shift toward higher molecular weight was observed for the monomeric form of BSL-B (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) which might be explained by a shift of the isoelectric point (pI) due to acetaldehyde-induced modifications. Alves <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] demonstrated that the electrophoretic mobility of a highly acidic protein could be increased by modifying acidic amino acid residues, resulting in an increased pI. This change of the pI increases the ability of the protein to bind SDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. For BSL-B, acetaldehyde induced modification results in a decrease of the pI (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>), which in turn probably decreases its ability to bind SDS and thus, explains the observed mobility shift (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Intramolecular cross-links, which most probably also occur, will potentially not give rise to a defined shift of the electrophoretic mobility, because there a several modification sites present on the protein surface, which prevents the formation of specific crossed-linked products. Separate substitution of each lysine residue in BSL-B against arginine and alanine, respectively, did not result in decreased lipase activity (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>, Figure S1). Thus, acetaldehyde-induced deactivation is not the consequence of modification of a single "hot-spot" lysine residue as previously suggested for <italic>G. geotrichum </italic>and <italic>C. rugosa </italic>lipases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Acetaldehyde sensitivity of BSL-B depends on enzyme concentration</title><p>BSL-B samples (0.025 - 0.5 mg/mL in 10 mM glycine/NaOH-buffer, pH 10) were incubated for 2 h in the presence of 500 mM acetaldehyde resulting in a molar excess of at least 2000 acetaldehyde molecules per BSL-B molecule.

The influence of different buffer components on colour formation was analyzed by incubating 500 mM acetaldehyde dissolved in water in the presence of glycine, NaOH and glycine/NaOH, respectively.

The influence of a protein on colour formation was tested with a highly purified preparation of bovine serum albumin (BSA).

Our results are supported by earlier findings reported in the literature, which also demonstrated the formation of <italic>&#x003b1;,&#x003b2;</italic>-unsaturated polyenals from acetaldehyde in the presence of bases and primary amino compounds in aqueous solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Specifically, 10 mM glycine in an aqueous 500 mM acetaldehyde solution was shown to catalyze the formation 2,4-hexadienal, 2,4,6-octatrienal, 2,4,6,8-decatetraenal, and longer chained polyenals, which leads to a reddish-brown to black colour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Hence, we assume that the colour formation we have observed is caused by the formation of <italic>&#x003b1;,&#x003b2;</italic>-unsaturated polyenals and the colour differences result from the different sizes of the respective conjugated <italic>&#x003c0;</italic>-electron systems formed.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>&#x003b1;,&#x003b2;</italic>-unsaturated polyenals bind to BSL-B by Michael addition</title><p>In comparison to acetaldehyde, <italic>&#x003b1;,&#x003b2;</italic>-unsaturated polyenals cannot only induce the formation of unstable Schiff-bases with primary amino groups, but are also capable of forming stable Michael-adducts by reaction of their double bond in <italic>&#x003b1;,&#x003b2;</italic>-position with the nucleophilic side chains of arginine, histidine, lysine and serine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. We analyzed differently composed samples (BSA (1 mg/mL), BSL-B (1 mg/mL), glycine (10 mM), NaOH (10 mM), and acetaldehyde (500 mM) in different combinations) to detect protein-bound carbonyl groups which are formed only by Michael-addition of <italic>&#x003b1;,&#x003b2;</italic>-unsaturated polyenals. The 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH)-assay revealed the formation of protein-carbonyl compounds only in the presence of NaOH and/or primary amino compounds (glycine or protein). In the presence of glycine, a three- to five-fold higher number of carbonyl groups was detected indicating a high catalytic efficiency of glycine as aldol condensation catalyst. The lower values determined for BSL-B as compared to BSA can be attributed to a lower number of modifiable amino acid residues (60 lysine residues per BSA molecule <italic>versus </italic>10 per BSL-B molecule). A more precise localization of the modification sites was attempted by analysis of acetaldehyde-treated BSL-B with MALDI-TOF-MS. MS-spectra showed considerable heterogeneity and sufficient material for analyses was difficult to obtain due to the modification of predominantly lysine residues which hampered trypsin digestion during sample preparation. Nevertheless, we succeeded to identify a modified peptide fragment with M<sub>w </sub>= 1507.711 Dalton consisting of amino acids Asn<sub>26</sub>-Lys<sub>37</sub>. Michael-addition of crotonaldehyde to the native Asn<sub>26</sub>-Lys<sub>37 </sub>fragment (M<sub>w </sub>= 1437.712 Da) would result in a theoretical molecular mass shift of 70.09 Da to give 1507.802 Da. This result is the first indication that <italic>&#x003b1;,&#x003b2;</italic>-unsaturated polyenals can interact with BSL-B and form stable Michael-adducts with surface exposed amino acid residues. Further indications were obtained by studying the direct inactivation of BSL-B with 2,4-hexadienal (see below), which was among the major <italic>&#x003b1;,&#x003b2;</italic>-unsaturated polyenals identified in our samples.</p></sec><sec><title>2,4-Hexadienal inactivates BSL-B not only by modification of lysine residues</title><p>In order to investigate the direct effect of <italic>&#x003b1;,&#x003b2;</italic>-unsaturated polyenals, we tested the ability of 2,4-hexadienal to inactivate BSL-B at concentrations of 0 mM, 10 mM, 25 mM, and 50 mM. As expected, BSL-B activity decreased with increasing 2,4-hexadienal concentrations. It is interesting to note that incubation of BSL-B with 50 mM 2,4-hexadienal reduced the hydrolytic activity to 19% after 24 h whereas no activity decrease was detected after incubation with the same concentration of acetaldehyde (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).</p><p>To identify the influence of primary amino groups (free glycine, N-termini, and lysine side chains, respectively) on the acetaldehyde induced deactivation, we analyzed differently treated BSL-B samples by SDS-PAGE and IEF, determined their residual hydrolytic activity, and also documented the colour after incubation with 500 mM acetaldehyde (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Comprehensive modification of primary amino groups with methylacetimidate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, samples 4 and 5, line A and B) abolished the formation of intermolecular cross-links and also a decrease of the pI (compare to Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). These results clearly indicate that both reactions are caused by Schiff-base modified lysine side chains. Subsequently, methylacetimidate was removed and acetaldehyde (samples 3-5) and fresh glycine/NaOH-buffer was added (sample 5). The addition of fresh glycine/NaOH buffer introduced unmodified glycine into the sample and its free amino groups can initiate the formation of &#x003b1;,&#x003b2;-unsaturated polyenals, which was additionally proven by the formation of coloured compounds in samples 3 und 5 (line D). Determination of the hydrolytic activity of samples 4 and 5 demonstrated that the activity of sample 5, which contained &#x003b1;,&#x003b2;-unsaturated polyenals, decreased by ~ 40% relative to sample 4 (defined as 100%). As all solvent accessible amino groups in BSL-B were modified by methylacetimidate, this effect can only be explained by modification of amino acid side chains other than those of lysine (e.g. of arginine, histidine, cysteine) with <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>,<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-unsaturated polyenals, as has earlier been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. In summary, about 40% of the acetaldehyde induced deactivation of BSL-B can be traced back to Michael-adduct formation at arginine, histidine, and serine side chains (BSL-B possesses no cysteine residues) and about 60% to the Michael-addition of <italic>&#x003b1;,&#x003b2;</italic>-unsaturated polyenals to lysine <italic>&#x003b5;</italic>-amino groups.</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Acetaldehyde-induced deactivation of BSL-B depends on the number of modifiable amino acid residues and on the presence of primary amino compounds in the solvent</bold>.

Until now, deactivation was thought to be caused by structural changes resulting from initial Schiff-base formation at solvent accessible lysine residues of the enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Using BSL-B as a model enzyme we demonstrate that acetaldehyde induced modifications lead to an increase of the enzymes' molecular mass presumably caused by intermolecular cross-linking and a decrease of the isoelectric point, respectively. These stable modifications of the enzyme can be explained by Michael-addition of <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>,<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-unsaturated polyenals, formed by aldol condensation of acetaldehyde in the presence of bases and/or amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Moreover, we found indications that these polyenals act as non-competitive inhibitors of the enzyme.</p><p>Our results further demonstrated that acetaldehyde-induced inactivation of microbial lipases can be avoided by adjusting the protonation state of the enzymes. Thus, "pH-tuning" of lipases cannot only preserve activity but also stability of the enzymes by effectively shielding surface exposed amino groups through protonation. This pre-treatment can avoid the formation of <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>,<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-unsaturated polyenals (if no other bases are present) and protonates primary amino groups which are, besides other nucleophilic side chains, most accessible to Michael-addition. As pH-changes may affect the activity and stability of the enzymes, a prerequisite of pH-tuning is sufficient stability and activity at weak acidic to neutral pH. Besides, free amino acids such as glycine, which is frequently used as a buffer component for lipase preparations, should be avoided for lipase preparations used in transesterification reactions with vinyl esters as they amplify the inactivation process.</p><p>Our findings also explain the higher stability of several immobilized lipase preparations which is caused by the minimization of solvent-accessible amino groups and other nucleophilic groups. In summary, our results allow us to propose a refined mechanism for acetaldehyde-induced deactivation of microbial lipases as summarized in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>How acetaldehyde inactivates microbial lipases</bold>. Deprotonated (-NH<sub>2</sub>) or protonated (-NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>) amino groups can be generated by lyophilization from buffers of the respective pH. Only deprotonated amino groups are able to form Schiff bases with acetaldehyde; they can induce the formation of intra- and intermolecular cross-links. Furthermore, bases and/or amino compounds (protein-bound amino groups, free amino compounds in the buffer) can catalyze the aldol condensation of acetaldehyde to <italic>&#x003b1;,&#x003b2;</italic>-unsaturated aldehydes which result in a yellow to brownish-black colour of the respective solution or protein. Finally, the formation of Michael-adducts between the enzyme and the <italic>&#x003b1;,&#x003b2;</italic>-unsaturated aldehydes leads to inactivation. At lower enzyme concentrations, the inactivation process proceeds fast; whereas fast aggregation of the enzyme at higher concentrations hampers the covalent modification thereby decelerating the inactivation process.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2091-12-10-6"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>The following chemicals were of analytical grade: acetaldehyde (Fluka, Taufkirchen, Germany), citric acid monohydrate (Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany), glycine (Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany), KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4 </sub>(Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany), sodium dodecyl sulfate (Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany), NaOH (Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany), Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4 </sub>(Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany), and TCA (Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany).</p><p>All other chemicals used in this study were of at least technical grade.</p></sec><sec><title>Enzymes and other proteins</title><p>Samples of lyophilized lipases (triacylglycerol hydrolases, EC 3.1.1.3) from <italic>C. rugosa </italic>(CRL, Sigma type VII), <italic>R. oryzae </italic>(ROL, Amano F-AP15), and <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens </italic>(PFL, Amano AK) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Taufkirchen, Germany).
