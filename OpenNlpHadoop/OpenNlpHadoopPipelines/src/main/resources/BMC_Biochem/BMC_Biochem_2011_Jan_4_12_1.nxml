For example, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), the causative agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), can infect human and chimpanzee cells, but is blocked in cells of Old World monkeys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In contrast, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac) infects Old World monkey cells but is restricted in the cells of most New World monkeys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. TRIM5&#x003b1;, a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family of proteins, mediates these early infection blocks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Differences in TRIM5&#x003b1; proteins among species account for the distinct patterns of retroviral restriction observed in mammalian lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. TRIM5&#x003b1; has been shown to bind and promote the premature uncoating of incoming retroviral capsids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Like all TRIM proteins, TRIM5&#x003b1; contains RING, B-box 2 and coiled coil domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The &#x003b1; isoform of TRIM5, which is the only TRIM5 isoform that exhibits antiretroviral activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], also has a carboxy-terminal B30.2(SPRY) domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Mutagenic studies have shed light on the contribution of the TRIM5&#x003b1; domains to antiretroviral activity. The RING domain, which exhibits E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, contributes to anti-HIV-1 potency, but is not absolutely required for a modest level of restriction ability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The B-box 2 domain is essential for higher-order associations among TRIM5&#x003b1; dimers and contributes to the cooperative binding of TRIM5&#x003b1; to the retroviral capsid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The coiled coil and adjacent linker (L2) region are sufficient for dimerization of TRIM5&#x003b1;, which results in a higher avidity of TRIM5&#x003b1;-capsid binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The direct contact between TRIM5&#x003b1; and the retroviral capsid is thought to be mediated by the B30.2(SPRY) domain. Surface-exposed loops within the TRIM5&#x003b1; B30.2(SPRY) domain exhibit pronounced variability and have been subject to positive selection during mammalian evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Amino acid changes in these B30.2(SPRY) variable loops or in the viral capsid protein can alter capsid recognition and the specificity of retrovirus restriction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].</p><p>Structural information on TRIM proteins is still limited. There are no published structures of a complete TRIM protein, even though some TRIM proteins (e.g., TRIM19 (promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein), TRIM20 (pyrin), TRIM18 (MID1), TRIM21 (Rho/SSA)) and TRIM37 (MUL)) have been studied extensively due to their association with human diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Poor expression levels and tendencies to aggregate into nuclear or cytoplasmic bodies have hampered efforts to obtain complete TRIM protein structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Nonetheless, structures of individual TRIM domains have been solved. The RING and B-box 2 structures of TRIM5 and other TRIM proteins have been solved by NMR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Structures of the B30.2(SPRY) domains of TRIM21 as well as of several proteins not in the TRIM family have been obtained by x-ray crystallography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. No structural information on the coiled-coil domain of any TRIM protein is available. Such information would be very valuable, as the coiled coil presumably resides near the dimeric axis and provides a central scaffold for the positioning of the other TRIM domains. The TRIM coiled coil is predicted to be alpha helical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>], but lacks easily identifiable heptad repeat motifs that characterize some of the classical coiled coils for which structural information is available.</p><p>Recently, we have devised approaches that allow expression of sufficient quantities of TRIM5&#x003b1; variants in baculovirus-infected cells for purification and biochemical characterization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Substitution of the TRIM21 RING domain for that of rhesus monkey TRIM5&#x003b1; resulted in a protein (TRIM5-21R) that was efficiently expressed and was purified. TRIM5-21R is a dimer and binds HIV-1 capsid-nucleocapsid (CA-NC) complexes assembled in vitro[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Binding of TRIM5-21R to HIV-1 CA-NC complexes depends upon the B30.2(SPRY) domain v1 variable region. Protease-resistant fragments of TRIM5-21R were characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Here we describe the expression in E. coli, purification and characterization of one such fragment containing the B-box, coiled coil and linker 2 (L2) region of rhesus monkey TRIM5&#x003b1;.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plasmid construction and production of recombinant BCCL2 protein</title><p>The recombinant bacterial construct expressing BCCL2 was prepared using the Champion pET Gateway vector with a kanamycin cassette(Invitrogen).

The eluted protein fraction was concentrated and was loaded on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) column (GE Healthcare). The column was equilibrated against PBS. Preparative SEC was run at 0.2 ml/min at 4&#x000b0;C. A calibration curve for molecular size estimation was generated by loading gel-filtration markers (Biorad) comprising thyroglobulin (667 kD), bovine gamma-globulin (158 kD), chicken ovalbumin (44 kD), equine myoglobin (17 kD) and Vitamin B<sub>12 </sub>(1.35 kD) proteins onto this SEC column and eluting under similar conditions. The resulting fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and those containing the BCCL2 protein were pooled and concentrated. For further purification, buffer was exchanged into 20 mM Tris-HCl/50 mM NaCl, pH 8 by using a PD-10 column (Pharmacia). Anion-exchange chromatography was subsequently performed on a 5-ml Q-Sepharose Hi-Trap column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl/50 mM NaCl, pH 8.0. Bound proteins were eluted by using a NaCl gradient (50 to 750 mM NaCl in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The BCCL2 protein was eluted with 400 mM NaCl, and fractions containing the protein were pooled, dialyzed and concentrated by ultrafiltration with Centricon-10 devices (Amicon). The cocktail of protease inhibitors (at the concentrations referred to above) was added to the samples throughout each stage of the purification scheme.

One of the major protease-resistant fragments of TRIM5&#x003b1;-21R consisted of the B-box 2 and coiled-coil domains, as well as the adjacent linker 2 (L2) region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Here, we produced this protease-resistant fragment (BCCL2) of rhesus monkey TRIM5&#x003b1; and verified that it is relatively resistant to trypsin digestion compared with the TRIM5&#x003b1;-21R protein. Protease resistance often is associated with the absence of conformationally flexible surface loops on a protein and thus might indicate a propensity to crystallize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>]. Although the polydispersity of the purified BCCL2 protein is high, an unfavorable predictor of crystallizability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>], additional modifications of the protein, optimization of solvent conditions or the inclusion of appropriate ligands may facilitate crystallization.</p><p>Our results demonstrate that, in the absence of other eukaryotic proteins, the BCCL2 protein forms dimers. Thus, the B-box 2 and coiled-coil domains, as well as the adjacent L2 region, are sufficient for TRIM5 dimerization. Neither of the terminal domains (i.e., RING or B30.2(SPRY)) is required for efficient dimerization. The estimates of the secondary structure content of the BCCL2 protein at different temperatures are consistent with predictions that the coiled-coil domain of TRIM proteins is mostly alpha helical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]. Exposure to 45&#x000b0;C resulted in a dissociation of the dimer and a decrease in the helicity of the protein. The integrity of the dimer interface and that of a subset of the alpha-helical structures on TRIM5 may be interconnected. Such a situation might be expected if dimeric contacts exist along the exposed surface of the alpha helices of each subunit of the dimer.</p><p>The BCCL2 dimers formed higher-order structures. Recently it has been reported that the full-length rhesus monkey TRIM5&#x003b1; protein forms dimers, trimers, hexamers and multimers of higher complexity in mammalian cells; the hexameric form in particular appeared to be the most abundant multimer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. TRIM5&#x003b1; multimerization does not involve disulfide bonds and is not affected by infection with restriction-sensitive viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The formation of the functional TRIM5 higher-order oligomers depends upon specific B-box 2 amino acid residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], several of which were altered in the BCCL2 protein without apparent disruption of the higher-order oligomerization. However, multiple changes in the B-box 2 surface did decrease the amount of large BCCL2 aggregates. This allowed more homogeneous preparations of a BCCL2 variant, LLER, to be analyzed by electron microscopy. Single-particle analysis revealed that the lower-molecular-weight form of LLER consisted of approximately 10-nm spheres. These LLER forms likely represent dimers; consistent with this, many examples of complexes consisting of two anti-His<sub>6 </sub>antibodies bound to a single LLER sphere were evident. The TRIM5 coiled coil, which is approximately 100 amino acid residues in length, could not be accommodated in these 10-nm spheres as a linear, rod-like structure; the existence of insertions at specific locations in the coiled coil regions of TRIM5 variants is consistent with the possibility that the coiled coil bends or folds back upon itself. The higher molecular weight LLER complexes formed C-shaped structures, with an appendage protruding from the convex side of the arc. The size of these structures is larger than that expected for a dimer, and possibly represents a pentamer or hexamer. We do not know if these higher-order structures are biologically relevant; it may be that the TRIM5&#x003b1; domains (RING and B30.2(SPRY)) not included in the BCCL2 construct influence higher-order self-association either quantitatively or qualitatively. Future work will explore these issues.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The central core of TRIM5&#x003b1;, consisting of the B-box 2, coiled coil and L2 linker region, forms dimers that are largely alpha helical.
