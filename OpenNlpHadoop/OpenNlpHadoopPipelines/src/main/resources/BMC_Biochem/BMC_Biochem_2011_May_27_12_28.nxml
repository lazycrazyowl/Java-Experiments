All VEGF-A isoforms encode homodimeric proteins that are glycosylated and secreted.

The splice variant VEGF-A<sub>165 </sub>is thought to be most effective mitogen due to moderate heparin affinity encoded by the heparin binding domain of exon-7. This domain also facilitates the binding of VEGF-A<sub>165 </sub>to neuropilin 1, a co-receptor which itself enhances binding of VEGF-A<sub>165 </sub>to VEGFR2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Binding to ATP has been shown to be important for a number of growth factors, including nerve growth factor (NGF), fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. For BDNF, at least, this appears to be mediated by covalent binding, based on the results from mass spectrometry of BDNF-ATP complex with electrospray ionization (ESI) techniques.

In the case of FGF-2, binding of ATP also imparts enhanced proteolytic and thermal resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In the present study, we detected binding of ATP to VEGF-A<sub>165</sub>, the predominant growth factor involved in neovascularization. Both radiolabeling (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) and mass spectrometry (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) analyses suggested that ATP bound to VEGF-A<sub>165 </sub>is independent of Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ions. The VEGF-A<sub>165</sub>-ATP complex appears to be extremely stable, remaining intact after denaturing SDS-PAGE, solid phase extraction and mass spectrometry techniques. In addition, an increase in ionic strength caused only a minor dissociation of the complex (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><p>The most physiologically important form of ATP is thought to be the ATP/Mg<sup>2+</sup>-complex, which is the predominant form of the nucleotide in tissue. Although our mass spectrometry analyses provide strong evidence that ATP bound to VEGF-A<sub>165 </sub>independently of Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ions, labeling of VEGF-A<sub>165 </sub>with [&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP could also be observed with 0.1 mM MgCl<sub>2 </sub>in the reaction buffer (data not shown). This is also true for labeling of the growth factor NGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Such ATP/Mg<sup>2+</sup>/growth factor complexes were identified by MALDI-TOF analysis of the growth factors FGF2 and NGF recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Radiolabeling of NGF with ATP is also possible in buffers containing Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Mn<sup>2+ </sup>or Ni<sup>2+</sup>, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Taken together, this indicates that VEGF-A<sub>165 </sub>also forms a complex with ATP at physiological Mg<sup>2+</sup>-concentrations.</p><p>Additionally, the recently discovered stabilization of FGF2 by ATP is also present when using Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. This observed stabilizing effect of ATP on the growth factor is present at Mg<sup>2+ </sup>concentrations of 0.1 mM. This indicates that under these conditions ATP/Mg<sup>2+ </sup>binds to FGF2 and that this physiological ATP/cation complex protects FGF2 against degradation, too. The effect of ectonucleases on the VEGF-A<sub>165</sub>-ATP complex also remains unknown. Our results suggest that the ATP bound to VEGF-A<sub>165 </sub>was not only completely susceptible to cleavage by alkaline phosphatase (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>), but also moderately susceptible to apyrase (data not shown).</p><p>Our results are consistent with the theory that growth factors bind ATP despite the absence of classic ATP binding site. Nevertheless, NGF, FGF-2 and VEGF-A<sub>165 </sub>contain heparin binding domains, characterized by clusters of basic residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], which may interact with the negatively charged phosphate residues of ATP. The removal of these basic residues by site-directed mutagenesis of NGF and FGF-2 has been shown to drastically reduced both ATP binding and neuroprotective activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Heparin has been shown to suppress the binding of ATP to VEGF-A<sub>165 </sub>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), however does not cause the existing VEGF-A<sub>165</sub>-ATP complex to dissociate. Nevertheless, the competition between ATP and heparin for binding to VEGF-A<sub>165 </sub>is likely to effect the interaction with the VEGF receptor or storage in the extracellular matrix.</p><p>Our results strongly suggest that ATP binding induces a conformational change in the secondary structure of VEGF-A<sub>165</sub>. We propose that this conformational change is responsible for the increased bioactivity of the VEGF-<sub>165</sub>-ATP complex, resulting in improved ligand-receptor interaction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The location at which ATP binds VEGF-A<sub>165</sub>, as well as the exact nature of the conformational change remains unknown.</p><p>Brandner <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] demonstrated that heparan sulfate induced a conformational change in glycosylated VEGF-A<sub>165 </sub>but not in the non-glycosylated form. In addition, they showed that heparin stabilized both glycosylated and non-glycosylated VEGF-A<sub>165 </sub>against chaotropic or thermal denaturation without inducing any conformational change. This implies that the competition of ATP and heparin (HSPGs) for binding to the mitogen is of biological relevance. Further studies have to be undertaken in order to define exactly where ATP is bound providing a basis for elucidating putative complex-receptor interactions.</p><p>We found no evidence that ATP binding protects VEGF-A<sub>165 </sub>against plasmin cleavage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), as previously suggested for FGF-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. We therefore propose that the biological activity of the VEGF-A<sub>165</sub>-ATP complex is due to improved receptor binding, and not due to increased stability of the growth factor. Supporting this theory, VEGF-A<sub>165 </sub>failed to induce HUVEC proliferation when the ATP concentration in the cell culture media was too low (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). This result corresponded to the minimal concentration of eATP required for the neuroprotective activity of NGF and FGF-2, which was determined to be approximately 1 nM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>In our cell culture experiments, alkaline phosphatase was required to lower the concentration of ATP to levels that affected cell proliferation. It is feasible that high concentrations of alkaline phosphatase had independent effects, and we cannot discount the possibility of minor contamination with proteases. Alkaline phosphatase added without exogeneous VEGF-A<sub>165 </sub>did not influence HUVEC viability (despite reducing eATP levels to 0.26 nM; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Therefore, we believe side effects of alkaline phosphates at these concentrations are unlikely. This is in line with investigations with other growth factors like FGF2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and NGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] that demonstrated similar results when using alkaline phosphatase to lower eATP-concentrations.</p><p>A completely different observation was made when using another growth factor, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF). This factor does not bind ATP and the neuroprotective activity of GCSF is not influenced by degradation of extracellular ATP by alkaline phosphatase (data not shown). This is in contrast to the situation with the ATP-binding growth factors FGF2 and NGF, where an extracellular ATP-concentration above about 1 nM is essential for the neuroprotective activity of these growth factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. However, this is plausible in the context of our hypothesis that ATP-growth factor interaction is essential for the activity of ATP-binding growth factors but not important for non-ATP-binding growth factors like GCSF. It is therefore reasonable to assume that the observed inhibition of HUVEC proliferation by VEGF-A<sub>165 </sub>was due to the low ATP levels caused by alkaline phosphatase, which prevented the formation of the presumed biologically active VEGF-A<sub>165</sub>-ATP complex.</p><p>It is known that eATP can act synergistically with angiogenic growth factors including VEGF-A<sub>165 </sub><italic>via </italic>P2Y receptor signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Even in the absence of VEGF-A<sub>165</sub>, the nucleotide itself is capable of P2Y<sub>1/2</sub>-VEGFR2 transactivation, inducing endothelial cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Given that activation of P2X and P2Y receptors requires eATP in the micromolar range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], isolated effects of eATP mediated by purinergic receptor signaling are unlikely to contribute to the experimental results obtained from our model (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). We have clearly shown that ATP is tightly bound to VEGF-A<sub>165 </sub>and a critical concentration of ATP above 1.8 nM is required for bioactivity. Based on these results, the VEGF-A<sub>165</sub>-ATP complex and not VEGF-A<sub>165 </sub>by itself appears to be the active ligand causing the proliferative effects under cell culture conditions. Both VEGF-A<sub>165</sub>-ATP complex formation and the putative interaction with its receptor remain to be elucidated <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>For the first time we provided ample evidence that ATP binds to VEGF-A<sub>165</sub>.
