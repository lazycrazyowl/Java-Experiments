Despite the identical disaccharide backbone, consisting of [&#x02192;4IdoA(2S)&#x003b2;-1&#x02192;3GalNAc&#x003b2;-1&#x02192;], those polymers differ in the position of sulfation on the N-Acetyl galactosamine, which can occur at carbon 4 or 6. We have shown that position rather than degree of sulfation is important for heparin cofactor II activity. As a consequence, 2,4- and 2,6-sulfated dermatans have high and low heparin cofactor II activities, respectively. In the present study we extended the disaccharide analysis of ascidian dermatan sulfates to additional species of the orders Stolidobranchia (<italic>Herdmania pallida</italic>, <italic>Halocynthia roretzi</italic>) and Phlebobranchia (<italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic>), aiming to investigate how sulfation evolved within Tunicata.

However, the degree of sulfation decreased from Stolidobranchia to Phlebobranchia. While 76% of the disaccharide units in dermatan sulfates from stolidobranch ascidians are disulfated, 53% of disulfated disaccharides are found in dermatan sulfates from phlebobranch ascidians. Besides this notable difference in the sulfation degree, dermatan sulfates from phlebobranch ascidians contain mainly 2,6-sulfated disaccharides whereas dermatan sulfate from the stolidobranch ascidians contain mostly 2,4-sulfated disaccharides, suggesting that the biosynthesis of dermatan sulfates might be differently regulated during tunicates evolution. Changes in the position of sulfation on N-acetylgalactosamine in the disaccharide [&#x02192;4IdoA(2-Sulfate)&#x003b2;-1&#x02192;3GalNAc&#x003b2;-1&#x02192;] modulate heparin cofactor II activity of dermatan sulfate polymers. Thus, high and low heparin cofactor II stimulating activity is observed in 2,4-sulfated dermatan sulfates and 2,6-sulfated dermatan sulfates, respectively, confirming the clear correlation between the anticoagulant activities of dermatan sulfates and the presence of 2,4-sulfated units.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results indicate that in ascidian dermatan sulfates the position of sulfation on the GalNAc in the disaccharide [&#x02192;4IdoA(2S)&#x003b2;-1&#x02192;3GalNAc&#x003b2;-1&#x02192;] is directly related to the taxon and that the 6-O sulfation is a novelty apparently restricted to the Phlebobranchia.

The extensive heterogeneity of the polymer results from variation in the degree of epimerization on carbon 5 of glucuronic acid, O-sulfation on carbon 4 or 6 of N-Acetyl galactosamine (GalNAc) and on carbon 2 of iduronic acid (IdoA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. It has been shown that regions enriched in [&#x02192;4IdoA(2S)&#x003b2;-1&#x02192;3GalNAc(4S)&#x003b2;-1&#x02192;] units in DS bind to heparin cofactor II (HCII) (2S and 4S represent 2-O- and 4-O-sulfate, respectively), enhancing the HCII-induced inhibition of thrombin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Previously, we reported the presence of highly sulfated DSs in solitary ascidians from orders Phlebobranchia (<italic>Phallusia nigra</italic>) and Stolidobranchia (<italic>Halocynthia pyriformis </italic>and <italic>Styela plicata</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. These polymers are composed by the same disaccharide backbone, consisting of [&#x02192;4IdoA(2S)&#x003b2;-1&#x02192;3GalNAc&#x003b2;-1&#x02192;], but differ in the position of sulfation on GalNAc, which can be sulfated at carbon 4 or 6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The DS from the stolidobranchs <italic>H.pyriformis </italic>and <italic>S.plicata </italic>are sulfated at carbon 2 of IdoA and carbon 4 of GalNAc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and are potent activators of HCII.

They belong to the phylum Chordata, subphylum Tunicata (Urochordata). Because of their basal position on the chordate phylogeny, ascidians are key to understanding chordate evolution and the origin of vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The traditional classification of the Ascidiacea includes three orders: Aplousobranchia, Stolidobranchia and Phlebobranchia. This traditional view has been disputed by many recent reconstructions of their evolution, gathering evidence of the paraphyly of Ascidiacea, although confirming the monophyly of Tunicata [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. While all ascidian orders include colonial forms, solitary species are only present in Stolidobranchia and Phlebobranchia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>The study of ascidians has demonstrated several ways in which these organisms can inform us about our own development and evolution. To increase our understanding about how DS sulfation evolved in chordates, we analyzed the disaccharide composition of DSs obtained from two species of stolidobranch (<italic>Herdmania pallida </italic>and <italic>Halocynthia roretzi</italic>), and one species of phlebobranch ascidians (<italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic>). The results were further compared with our previous data on DSs from other ascidians of the same orders. In addition, we investigated the ability of the ascidian DSs to potentiate HCII. Our results indicate that in ascidians the position of sulfation on the GalNAc in the disaccharide [&#x02192;4IdoA(2S)&#x003b2;-1&#x02192;3GalNAc&#x003b2;-1&#x02192;] is directly related to the taxon and that the 6-O sulfation is a novelty apparently restricted to the Phlebobranchia.

Tunicates are proposed in some phylogenies as the closest living relatives of the vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], although most of the recent reconstructions still place the Cephalochordata as the sister group of the back-boned animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>In order to study how sulfation of DS evolved in tunicates we compared the disaccharide composition of DS polymers obtained from ascidians of two different orders: Stolidobranchia and Phlebobranchia. The disaccharide analysis indicated a high content of disulfated disaccharide units in the DSs from both taxa. Interestingly, the degree of DS sulfation decreased on Phlebobranchia clade. Thus, 76% of the disaccharide units in the DSs from stolidobranch ascidians are disulfated, compared to 53% in the DSs from the phlebobranch. In fact, the two taxa probably diverged early during the evolution of tunicates. Phlebobranch ascidians have a simpler pharynx, without the folds present in the stolidobranch. Additionally, the phlebobranch blood contains usually vanadium, while stolidobranch has iron instead [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Other important distinctions are present in terms of the development of the atrial cavity and position of the gonads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Also, the aforementioned recent hypotheses about the evolution of the tunicates place the thaliaceans within the Phlebobranchia. Therefore, the study of the DS composition of thaliaceans will be relevant to understand the evolutionary history of the group.</p><p>The sulfation pattern of the tunicate DS disaccharides showed interesting results, pointing to an evident structural difference: DS from phlebobranch ascidians contain mainly 2,6-sulfated disaccharides, whereas DSs from stolidobranch ascidians contain mostly 2,4-sulfated disaccharides. Although information about sulfation pattern in DS from other Deuterostomia is scanty, both types of sulfation are found in vertebrates. While 2,4-sulfated disaccharides are commonly found in extracellular DS proteoglycans, such as decorin and biglycan present in different tissues as tendon, cartilage or skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], significant yet small proportions (5%) of 2,6-sulfated units have been found in mouse or pig brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and the biosynthetic regulation of the expression of 2,6-sulfated disaccharides by 6-O-sulfotransferases, 2-O-sulfotransferase and C5-epimerase might play critical roles in the development of the hippocampus and cerebellum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Considering those data, our results point to the 2,4-sulfation as a conserved feature along Chordata and the predominance of 2,6-sulfated disaccharides as the derived condition. Further investigation on the DS structure of echinoderms and hemichordates should clarify this issue.</p><p>In vertebrate chordates, four groups of sulfotransferases are involved in the modification of CS/DS: (1) DS-specific 4-O-sulfotransferase; (2) chondroitin 6-O-sulfotransferase; (3) uronyl 2-O-sulfotransferase; (4) GalNAc-4-sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase. Interestingly, a comprehensive survey of sulfotransferases in the ascidian <italic>C. intestinalis </italic>showed similarity to vertebrate CS/DS-specific sulfotransferases. From eight <italic>C.intestinalis </italic>proteins found to be closely related to DS/CS 4-O-sulfotransferases, four were proposed to have arisen by duplication during the evolution of tunicates. Although eight genes encoding C6ST-like proteins were also found in <italic>C. intestinalis </italic>genome, their evolutionary history was not clear. It was suggested that divergence of the C6ST family genes has occurred independently during the evolution of tunicate, cephalochordate and vertebrate lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. <italic>C. intestinalis </italic>genome presented also four genes encoding urosyl 2-O-sulfotransferases, one of them very closely related to human 2-O-sulfotransferases. However, a GalNAc-4-sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase homologous gene was not found in <italic>C. intestinalis </italic>genome. In fact, no 4,6-sulfated disaccharides were found in DSs from <italic>C. intestinalis </italic>or other ascidians analyzed in the present work, despite the high content of 4-O-sulfated N-acetylgalactosamine in stolidobranch ascidians and the presence of these units also in <italic>C. intestinalis</italic>. On the other hand, albeit up 90% of disaccharide units in DS from <italic>P. nigra </italic>contains 6-O-sulfated N-acetylgalactosamine, no 4-O-sulfated units were found.</p><p>The differences in the sulfation patterns from <italic>C. intestinalis </italic>and <italic>P. nigra </italic>may also result from divergent evolution, as these species are not closely related within the Phlebobranchia. Our results on the structure of DSs from ascidians add to Tetsukawa's results, suggesting different mechanisms for GAG sulfation according to taxa, which may have been emerged via gene duplication, occurring independently in each group and leading to different types of 4-O-sulfotransferases and 6-O-sulfotransferases in ascidians and vertebrates, with distinct substrate specificities.</p><p>The high affinity binding of DS to HCII requires a rare sequence consisting of [IdoA(2S)-GalNA(4S)]<sub>3 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Interestingly, DS with higher sulfation levels bind poorly to HCII, suggesting significant specificity of interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Corroborating with this idea, recent work has shown that a specific geometry of the [IdoA(2S)-GalNA(4S)]-hexasaccharide, which forms a 2<sub>1</sub>-helix topology (2<sub>1</sub>-&#x000b0;S<sub>2</sub>.<sup>1</sup>C<sub>4</sub>.<sup>1</sup>C<sub>4</sub>), is required for high affinity binding to HCII [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. This geometry allows the interaction of the [IdoA(2S)-GalNA(4S)]-hexasaccharide with key aminoacids involved in the binding to HCII and the correct orientation for the binding to exocite II of thrombin. Extention of the high-affinity sequence in DS polymers is expected to increase the binding and the activity of HCII [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>In the present, work we observed that ascidian DSs with increasing content of 2,4-sulfated disaccharides showed increasing HCII activity, (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A-B</xref>). Therefore, in consonance with the previous paragraphy, it is possible to suggest that in the HCII-active DSs, [IdoA(2S)-GalNA(4S)]-disaccharides are clustered in 2<sub>1</sub>-helix topology (2<sub>1</sub>-&#x000b0;S<sub>2</sub>.<sup>1</sup>C<sub>4</sub>.<sup>1</sup>C<sub>4</sub>) sequences with inceasing lengh.</p><p>Finally, an interesting characteristic of ascidians is their ability to rapid vessel regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Such event, taken together with the fact that in vertebrates DS have been demonstrated to be involved in wound repair, raises intriguing questions concerning the molecular mechanisms underlying angiogenesis. Is the presence of oversulfated DS in ascidians related to fast vessel regeneration by binding to growth factors?</p><p>Furthermore, the drastic difference between the DS disaccharide units from phlebobranch and stolidobranch ascidians may also be related to an angiogenesis event. The alteration between a 2,4 disaccharide from Stolidobranchia to a 2,6 disaccharide in Phlebobranchia might be involved in the branchial vessel organization. One of the main differences between these two ascidian orders is the pharyngeal structure. Phlebobranch ascidians possess a simpler pharynx, without folds and usually with less internal vessels. On the other hand, stolidobranch ascidians have a more complex structure, with a folded pharynx and a larger number of internal vessels. The DS structural differences from both ascidian orders could be related to the pharynx vascular organization.</p><p>Notably the evolution of glycosaminoglycans in animals including invertebrates as well as vertebrates has also recently been reviewed in terms of their structure and biological activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results indicate that in ascidians the position of sulfation on the GalNAc in the disaccharide [&#x02192;4IdoA(2S)&#x003b2;-1&#x02192;3GalNAc&#x003b2;-1&#x02192;] is directly related to the taxon and that the 6-O sulfation is a novelty apparently restricted to the Phlebobranchia.
