Pharmacological thrombolysis using streptokinase, urokinase or tissue activator of plasminogen (t-PA) and mechanical interventions are frequently employed to treat both arterial and venous thrombotic diseases. Unfortunately, reperfusion is not always achieved and the success of the therapy is limited by reocclusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Limitations to these approaches also include complications such as bleeding, stroke, clot embolization and vessel wall damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Increasing evidence from <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], animal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and initial patients studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] indicates that application of ultrasound (US) as an adjunct to thrombolytic therapy offers unique potential to improve effectiveness and decrease bleeding complications. Now, four basic approaches to US thrombolysis have been pursued - two without pharmacological agents: (1) catheter-delivered external transducer US, (2) transcutaneous-delivered HIFU external US without drug delivery and US in conjunction with thrombolytic drugs and/or microbubbles or other agents, (3) catheter-delivered transducer-tipped US with local drug delivery, and (4) transcutaneous-delivered low frequency US with concomitant systemic (intravenous) drug delivery for site specific US augmentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Based on the available information the mechanisms involved in the fibrinolytic process in high-frequency, low-intensity US-enhanced fibrinolysis have been suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] to be non drug-specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], not to alter the sizes of plasmatic derivatives or degradation products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and not to be caused by clot disruption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. US with a frequency of 1 MHz and intensities of 2.5-3.1 W/cm<sup>2 </sup>had no statistically significant impact on biological activity of plasminogen activators: urokinase, streptokinase, alteplase and reteplase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. There is a limited data on the potential effect of US on proteins. It has been shown that high frequency (1 MHz) US with intensity of 6.92 W/cm<sup>2 </sup>caused changes in structural order of cytochrome <italic>c</italic>, lysozyme, myoglobin, bovine serum albumin, trypsinogen and &#x003b1;-chymotrypsinogen A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. At low intensity US accelerates enzymatic thrombolysis through non-thermal mechanisms involving improvement in drug transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], reversibly altering fibrin structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and increasing t-PA binding to fibrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Recent studies indicated that US at lower frequencies in the range of 20-40 kHz and impulse mode with duty cycles of 1 to 50% has a greater effect on thrombolysis with improved tissue penetration and less heating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. High intensity US disrupts clots into small fragments without administration of plasminogen activator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The main mechanism by which ultrasonic lysis of thrombus occurs is termed the "cavitation effect." During the negative phase of the ultrasonic wave, microbubbles (or cavities) form within tissue exposed to the sound source. During the positive phase of the wave, these cavitations collapse, giving rise to a series of shock waves that lead to disruption and fragmentation. However, despite the documented efficiency, further clinical application of US angioplasty is restricted by the initiation of distal embolization of the resulting clot debris [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Our previously study demonstrated that at the conditions of a combined cavitation and streptokinase action at high US intensities, streptokinase preventing the formation of large clot debris conglomerates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Based on this, we assume that the use of low frequency (20-40 kHz) impulse (duty cycle 1-50%) mild intensity (10-50 W/cm<sup>2</sup>) US in combination with thrombolytic drugs will make it possible to decrease the risk of side effects development. The effectiveness of this approach has been confirmed by our in animal study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>With a number of described above mechanisms of US thrombus destruction and US enhanced fibrinolysis additional mechanisms may underlie the effects of US thrombolysis Analyses of the products of the plasma clot destruction by the low-frequency ultrasound (27 kHz) showed that at the US intensities below 21.6 W/cm<sup>2</sup>, there was extraction of blood serum proteins located in the pores of the fibrin network. The increase in intensity of the ultrasonic treatment was accompanied by protofibrils disaggregation and extraction of blood serum proteins located inside fibrin fibers. Proteins extracted from the plasma clot underwent subsequent aggregation, whereas interaction between protofibrils caused formation of insoluble fibrin particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Thus, low frequency and high intensity ultrasound together with the macroscopic disruption of the clot can affect structural-functional properties of proteins.</p><p>It has been previously shown that usage of low frequency US (26 kHz) with intensity up to 15 W/cm<sup>2 </sup>does not influence properties of streptokinase and antithrombin III. At US intensity exceeding 26 W/cm<sup>2</sup>, plasminogen activator streptokinase undergoes irreversible aggregation with unfolding of protein molecule and exposure of new peptide bonds susceptible for proteolytic attack by plasmin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. After US treatment, antithrombin III is converted into inactive forms (latent and polymeric aggregates), whereas non-activated blood clotting factors belonging to the &#x003b1;-chymotrypsin superfamily do not change their structural and functional parameters within PPSB complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. At the same time, a functional model of activation of equimolar mixture of &#x003b1;-chymotrypsinogen and trypsinogen revealed that trypsin is the most sensitive to the US treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>The aim of current studies was to investigate the effects of low frequency high intensity pulse US (25.1 kHz, 48.4 W/cm2, duty 50%) on the key protein of the blood coagulation - fibrinogen, as well as to investigate the effects of US on the fibrinolysis in an <italic>in vitro system</italic>. It has been shown that ultrasound induced time-dependent formation of fibrinogen aggregates, characterized by loss of clotting ability and greater rate of plasminolysis than native fibrinogen and denaturation of plasminogen and t-PA. Under ultrasound treatment of plasminogen and/or t-PA in the presence of fibrin(ogen), the stabilizing effect of fibrin(ogen) on given proteins was demonstrated. On the other hand, an increase in the rate of fibrin(ogen) lysis was observed due to both the change in the substrate structure and promoting of the protein-protein complexes formation. Studies in this direction are address the key question how to minimize side effects and increase the effectiveness of ultrasonic trombolysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>The following reagents were used in this study: SDS, 2-mercaptoethanol, Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250, tris-(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, N, N, N', N'- tetramethylenediamine, glycine, ammonium persulfate ("Serva", Germany);the mixture of the inhibitors of proteases ("Roche", Germany), N.N'-methylene-bis-acrylamide, ("Reanal", Hungary); the collection of protein standards for the gel-electrophoresis (phosphorylase B (97.4 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), carboanhydrase (29 kDa)) ("Serva", Germany); Lysine-Sepharose were obtained by the immobilization of lysine to epichlorohydrin-activated Sepharose-4B CL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>The t-PA was obtained from the manufacturer (recombinant t-PA, Actilyse, "Boehringer Ingelheim", Germany) was dissolved in 0.05 M Tris-HCl, 0.15 M NaCl (pH 7.4) to give a final concentration of 10 mg/ml and stored at -20&#x000b0;C.

Obviously, in this case a larger quantity of already formed active plasmin was added to fibrinogen. In turn, beforehand US treatment of the mixture of plasminogen with t-PA leads to considerable reduction in the fibrinogenolysis rate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, line <italic>5</italic>).

Initial fibrinogen contained sufficient quantity of factor XIII for complete covalent cross-linking of fibrin monomers. Plasminolysis was initiated by addition of the plasminogen and t-PA to the fibrinogen solution. The process of the fibrinolysis, like fibrinogenolysis, was controlled by the determination of the concentration of TCA-soluble peptide formation. As in the case of fibrinogen, US-treatment leads to the increased rate of proteolysis in both cases, after treating the clot itself and clot in the presence of plasminogen and/or rt-PA. SDS-PAGE of fibrin degradation products revealed that already after 2 hour of hydrolysis mainly D-dimers were present. At the same time, in the degradation products of previously US-treated fibrin parallel with D-dimers early fibrin degradation products - fragments X and Y were present (data not shown). Analysis by the scanning electron microscopy (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>) showed that clot revealed many deepening of 4 - 10 &#x003bc;m in size as a result of the US action on the surface of fibrin. The analysis of the internal structure of the clot showed that multiple channels appeared near the clot surface. These channels were 1-2 &#x003bc;m in diameter, and 20-45 &#x003bc;m in length (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>. <italic>c</italic>). Changes were also observed in the fibrin network that acquired fine-mesh shape due to mach irregular disruptions of fibers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>. <italic>d</italic>). The quantitative analysis of the image showed substantial changes in parameters of the US-treated fibrin network compared to control. The ultrasound caused decrease of length and diameter of fibrin fibers, but at the same time increase in pore size.</p><fig id="F9" position="float"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p><bold>Images of control (<italic>a</italic>, <italic>b</italic>) and US-treated (<italic>c</italic>, <italic>d</italic>) fibrin clot obtained by scanning electron microscopy at different magnifications</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2091-12-60-9"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study demonstrated that the US did not cause the cleavage of peptide and interchain disulfide bonds or formation of interchain and intermolecular cross-links in case of fibrinogen (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Additionally, results presented here suggested that the US did not induce the conformational changes in the fibrinogen molecule leading to the exposure of a new plasmin-sensitive site (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Our results are consistent with previously reported data describing the effect of high-frequency US on fibrinogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and fibrin clot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, sonication of fibrinogen with the US (25.1 kHz, 48.4 W/cm2, duty 50%) led to the time-dependent loss of the clotting ability (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). It has been reported that the &#x003b3;- irradiation and free-radical oxidation leads to a loss of the clotting ability and increase of the sensitivity to the proteolytic degradation as a result of the fibrinogen aggregate formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. To determine if the US induced aggregation of fibrinogen, the gel-permeation chromatography of fibrinogen was carried out before and after the sonication (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The results of gel-permeation chromatography indicated that the formation of fibrinogen aggregates was induced by the US. It has been shown before that aggregation of antithrombin III and streptokinase was also induced by the US [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>Our study demonstrated that the US differentially affected individual proteins and led in case of fibrinogen (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, line <italic>2</italic>) to increase, and in case of plasminogen (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, line <italic>3</italic>) and t-PA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, line <italic>4</italic>) to decrease of fibrinogenolysis rate. It should be noted that no change in the speed of the fibrinogen hydrolysis was observed using the high-frequency US [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>It is known that in the presence of fibrinogen, fibrin and their degradation products, the rate of plasminogen activation by t-PA increases due to the formation of tertiary complex: fibrin(ogen) - plasminogen - t-PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In this case, fibrin potentiates at greater extent an activation rate at the expense of the exposure of the plasminogen and t-PA binding sites that are latent in the fibrinogen molecule. It has been reported that the removal of fibrinopeptides A and B switches interaction of &#x003b1;C-domain from intra- to intermolecular interaction, facilitating the self-association of fibrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In this regard, the conformational changes occur, which led to the exposure of the plasminogen and t- PA binding sites on the &#x003b1;C-domain surface. At the same time, D-region also contains latent t-PA and the plasminogen binding sites. The exposure of these sites is a result of the noncovalent binding D-D:E [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. As demonstrated above, US led to the formation of fibrinogen associates with the larger molecular weight. Therefore, it is possible to suggest that the US produces conformational changes in the fibrinogen molecule leading to the exposure of polymerization sites and, as a result, of the plasminogen- and t-PA binding sites. These processes lead to an increase in the rate of the proteolytic degradation of fibrinogen. In turn, a decrease in the fibrinogenolysis rate in cases of prior sonication of plasminogen and t-PA is the result of inactivation of the active forms of these proteins, as it was demonstrated above. The effect of US inactivation enzymes was shown on example of functional model of activation of equimolar mixture of &#x003b1;-chymotrypsinogen and trypsinogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. High sensitivity of t-PA to the US-action is explained by the unique structure of this protein. In comparison with other proenzymes, the single-chain tissue-type plasminogen activator possesses its own catalytic activity. Moreover, the activities of the single- and two-chain t-PA differ only by a factor of 3-9. Existing evidence strongly suggests that Lys<sup>156 </sup>and Asp<sup>194 </sup>interact directly in single-chain t-PA and that this interaction stabilizes the active conformation of the enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>The obtained results suggest that the preliminary US-treatment of the mixture of fibrinogen with plasminogen leads not to a decrease in the fibrinogenolysis rate, as in case of sonicated plasminogen, but to its increase. The US-treatment of the mixture of fibrinogen with plasminogen, most probably, does not cause any changes in plasminogen, and summary effect is caused by the action on the fibrinogen. It may be assumed that the basic effect of the US on the proteins is caused by the generation of free hydroxyl radicals in the field of US cavitation. Thus, under the condition fibrinogen can act as the "scavenger" of free radicals and, correspondingly, summary effect on the fibrinogen proteolytic degradation for combined US-treatment is determined exclusively by effect on fibrinogen. It is consistent with the fact that fibrinogen appears to be a plasma protein that is most sensitive to <italic>in vitro </italic>metal-ion-catalyzed carbonyl formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. During structural effect induced by therapeutic ultrasound on aqueous solution of six different proteins (cytochrome <italic>c</italic>, lysozyme, myoglobin, bovine serum albumin, trypsinogen and &#x003b1;-chymotrypsinogen A) important role of free radicals, produced by water sonolysis, in the changes of structural order was suggest too [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Statistical analysis showed the absence of differences in the kinetic curves of fibrinogenolysis in the following cases of US-treatment: <italic>a</italic>) fibrinogen; <italic>b</italic>) fibrinogen with rt-PA; <italic>c</italic>) fibrinogen with plasminogen and d) fibrinogen, plasminogen and rt-PA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Thus, in case of US-treatment of the protein mixtures effect US on the fibrinogen proteolytic degradation is determined exclusively by effect on fibrinogen. The same results were obtained in the study of the influence of US-processing on the fibrinolysis.</p><p>It has been shown before that the US-treatment leads to an increase in the binding t-PA with fibrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. By the scanning electron microscopy showed changes of the fibrin network in the process of US-treatment. Data showed that US leads to formation of many channels in the internal structure of the clot, and irregular disruption and thinning of fibrin fibers at the level of fibrin network structure are observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). It has been demonstrated earlier that disturbances of the fibrin network under the US-action lead to an increase in the penetration of t-PA inside the clot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Due to the increased number of plasminogen/plasmin binding sites, the rate of proteolysis was increased. Obtained data well agree with the layer-by-layer model of the fibrin degradation, in the case of the penetration of the plasminogen activator inside the clot due to the diffusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Thus, in the control experiment the step-by-step hydrolysis of fibrin was occurred and the large fragments of fibrin were not released into the solution. At US-treatment of fibrin, the proteolysis took place in entire volume of clot and, respectively, the large fragments were released into solution. This is confirmed by the fact that after two hours of hydrolysis in the degradation products of previously US-treated fibrin parallel with D-dimers early fibrin degradation products - fragments X and Y were present, there are not in control. The same differences were observed also at the fibrin clot lysis, induced by circulating and clot-embedded proteases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>In summary, under ultrasound treatment of plasminogen and/or t-PA in the presence of fibrin(ogen), the stabilizing effect fibrin(ogen) on given proteins was shown, while an increase in the fibrin(ogen)lysis rate was demonstrated due to both the change in the substrate structure and promoting of the protein-protein complexes formation. This allows us to recommend for the <italic>in vivo </italic>experiments simultaneous introduction of plasminogen activators with the US action and limiting duration of US action by the not more than 5 min.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our study demonstrated that the US induces fibrinogen aggregate formation <italic>in vitro</italic>, characterized by loss of clotting ability and greater rate of plasminolysis than native fibrinogen.
