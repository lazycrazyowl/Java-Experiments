In mammals, conversion of adenosine triphosphate to adenosine is catalyzed in a two-step process: ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases (ecto-NTDPases) hydrolyze ATP and ADP to AMP, whereas 5'-nucleotidases hydrolyze AMP to adenosine.

These include several toxins that are known for their detrimental effects on host cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], in particular cells of the immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Staphylococci can infect a broad range of tissues and organs resulting in excessive tissue damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. This observation is highlighted by the appearance of large populations of necrotic cells surrounding staphylococcal communities within organ abscesses isolated from infected mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Cellular damage caused by bacterial triggers the release of otherwise sequestered intracellular components such as heat shock proteins (HSPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], S100 proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], nucleosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], N-formylated mitochondrial peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and purines (ATP and ADP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] all of which are known to potently stimulate inflammation. Excessive inflammation can be detrimental to the host due to the prolonged presence of activated immune cells as well as the leakage of proteases and other noxious agents that damage surrounding tissues. A delicate balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators is critical to prevent extensive inflammation.</p><p>Extracellular nucleotides (i.e. adenosine tri-, di- and monophosphates and adenosine), which signal through purinergic cell surface receptors have recently been shown to serve as mediators of inflammation. For example, stimulation of purinergic PY receptors by ATP and ADP results in pro-inflammatory responses while stimulation of PX adenosine receptors leads to an anti-inflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In addition, nucleotide metabolizing enzymes that hydrolyze adenosine tri- and di-phosphates (ATP and ADP) or adenosine monophosphates (AMP), termed ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases (ecto-NTPDases) or 5'-nucleotidases respectively, regulate purinergic signaling by controlling the level of extracellular nucleotides. NTPDases hydrolyze nucleoside tri- and/or diphosphates, but not monophosphates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Eight members of the NTPDase family have been identified in mammals, all of which are characterized by five highly conserved sequence motifs known as "apyrase conserved regions" (ACR), which range from 4-13 residues in length [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. CD39 (NTDPase 1) was the first member identified for this family of enzymes. It is expressed on activated B cells and regulatory T (T<sub>reg</sub>) cells. Hydrolysis of 5'-AMP is carried out by a second class of enzymes. CD73 is the best characterized of the 5'-nucleotidases; CD73 hydrolyzes 5'-AMP specifically and shows no activity towards 2'- and 3'-monophosphates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. This ecto-enzyme is expressed in different tissues, with abundant expression in the colon, kidney, liver, heart, lung and on specific cells of the immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. CD73 and CD39 are co-expressed on the surfaces of CD<sup>+4</sup>/CD<sup>+25</sup>/Foxp3<sup>+ </sup>T<sub>reg </sub>cells and catalyze the enzymatic conversion of ATP/ADP-derived AMP into the anti-inflammatory mediator adenosine, subsequently leading to inhibition of T cell proliferation and secretion of cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>We recently reported that <italic>S. aureus </italic>AdsA, a cell wall anchored protein, is a 5'-nucleotidase that catalyzes the conversion of AMP to adenosine. The nucleotidase activity of AdsA is critical for <italic>S. aureus </italic>survival in blood and <italic>adsA </italic>mutants are impaired in their ability to induce abscess formation during infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Thus, we surmise that <italic>S. aureus </italic>uses AdsA to increase the concentration of adenosine concentrations within the host and take advantage of adenosine's immunosuppressive properties to escape immune clearance. Since staphylococci are surrounded by large populations of dead or dying host cells within deep tissue abscesses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], it can be assumed that there is an abundance of extracellular nucleotides released from damaged tissues. The importance of extracellular nucleotide signaling in mediating pathogen clearance led us to further investigate AdsA's nucleotide metabolizing capacity. Although analyses of the amino acid sequence of AdsA did not reveal conserved ACR motifs indicative of NTPDases, a recombinant AdsA was able to efficiently hydrolyze both ATP and ADP <italic>in vitro</italic>. We further characterized the enzyme kinetics of AdsA hydrolysis of ATP, ADP and AMP and also identified amino acid residues critical for AdsA's hydrolase activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Purification of recombinant AdsA</title><p>Recombinant GST-tagged AdsA (rAdsA) was expressed using pVT1 in <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>BL21 (DE3) and purified using glutathione S-transferase affinity chromatography as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].

However, extracellular ATP and ADP stimulate inflammation as well. We wondered whether AdsA might also hydrolyze these molecules. Hydrolysis was assessed following incubation with rAdsA for 15 min by measuring the release of inorganic phosphate using the malachite green colorimetric assay. rAdsA hydrolyzed ATP and ADP efficiently. In fact, the enzyme released 1.5 fold more phosphate from ATP and ADP after 15 min incubation than from AMP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). In addition, rAdsA hydrolyzed both guanosine derivatives GTP and GDP, albeit at reduced efficiency compared to ATP and ADP. In comparison, the inosine nucleosides ITP and IDP were poor substrates for the enzyme (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B, C</xref>).

NTPDases encompass five conserved ACR motifs that form the active site of these enzymes. Such ACR motifs indicative of NTPDases cannot be found in the primary sequence of AdsA.

For example, CD39/NTPDase1 hydrolyzes both ATP and ADP with similar efficiency, whereas NTPDase2 preferentially exhibits ATPase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. We examined and compared the relative rate of ATP, ADP and AMP hydrolysis by rAdsA at pH 7.5 in the presence of 0.5 mM MnCl<sub>2 </sub>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The rate of inorganic phosphate released from all three nucleotides was linear over the first 20 min of incubation (with linear regression using GraphPad Prism5 software yielding r<sup>2 </sup>value of 0.90, 0.98 and 0.96 for AMP, ADP and ATP hydrolysis, respectively). The initial rate of reaction varied with the concentration of substrate (AMP or ADP) and followed the Michaelis-Menten kinetic model of a single-substrate reaction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). GraphPad Prism5 software was used to perform nonlinear regression analysis and a <italic>V<sub>max </sub></italic>value 713 &#x003bc;mol Pi/min/mg for ADP hydrolysis compared to 391 &#x003bc;mol Pi/min/mg for AMP hydrolysis together with a calculated <italic>K<sub>m </sub></italic>value of 0.93 mM for AMP and 0.51 mM for ADP. The total release of inorganic phosphate from 1 mM ADP was approximately 1.8 times higher than from 1 mM AMP after 10 minutes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). ADP contains two phosphate groups to a single phosphate group in AMP suggesting similar hydrolysis rates for both the &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-phosphate groups. However, only a slight increase in inorganic phosphate was observed from 1 mM ATP relative to 1 mM ADP over the same time period, suggesting that AdsA may preferentially hydrolyze the &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-phosphate groups of AMP and ADP compared to the &#x003b3;-phosphate in ATP.

Conversely, subsitution of His<sup>196 </sup>to Ala led to a moderate reduction of AMP hydrolysis (65% &#x000b1; 3% of wild-type activity) but significantly affected the ADPase activity of the enzyme (23% &#x000b1; 5% of wild-type activity) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A,B</xref>). Next, we asked whether reduced AMP or ADP hydrolysis by the variant proteins (specifically Asp<sup>127</sup>Ala, His<sup>196</sup>Ala and Asp<sup>199</sup>Ala) could be explained by a loss of affinity for the substrates. Wild-type and variants of rAdsA were incubated with either [<sup>14</sup>C]AMP or [<sup>14</sup>C]ADP at 4&#x000b0;C degrees for 10 min and adsorbed onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Unbound [<sup>14</sup>C] labeled nucleotide was removed by extensive washes of the membranes and measurements of radioactivity counts were recorded as a direct assessment of nucleotide binding to the enzymes. All three mutants (Asp<sup>127</sup>Ala, His<sup>196</sup>Ala and Asp<sup>199</sup>Ala) bound [<sup>14</sup>C]AMP or [<sup>14</sup>C]ADP with affinities similar to the wild type rAdsA enzyme (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C,D</xref>). Furthermore, we recorded circular dichroism (CD) spectra and confirmed that none of the substitutions altered the secondary structure of rAdsA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>). Together, these data identify rAdsA residues implicated in metal ion binding as well as its Asp-His catalytic dyad, two AdsA features that are shared with other 5'-nucleotidases.</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Amino acid substitutions of conserved residues present in the 5'-nucleotidase signature sequences affects the level of AdsA activity</bold>.

In this study, we defined the enzymatic properties of rAdsA and demonstrated that in addition to exhibiting 5'-nucleotidase activity, rAdsA also exhibits NTPDase activity. This was exemplified by rAdsA's ability to hydrolyze ADP and ATP and to a lower extent GDP and GTP, with its ADPase activity retained even under acidic conditions. In contrast, the enzyme was not able to utilize CDP or CTP.</p><p>In mammals, the conversion of ATP to adenosine requires the sequential activity of ecto-NTPDases and 5'-nucleotidases. The substrate specificities of the two types of enzyme are quite specific as CD39 (NTPDase1) cleaves ATP and ADP but not AMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and likewise CD73 (5'-nucleotidase) cleaves AMP but not ATP and ADP. Substrate specificity is thought to result from structural differences between the binding pockets of NTPDases and 5'-nucleotidases. Active site residues lying within the NTPDase ACR motifs are shown to be situated in close proximity of the &#x003b3;- and &#x003b2;-phosphate groups of ATP whereas the &#x003b1;-phosphate of an AMP molecule would be further buried and inaccessible. We identified amino acid residues Asp<sup>127 </sup>and His<sup>196 </sup>within the conserved 5'-nucleotidase signature sequences as being critical for ADP hydrolysis. Furthermore, results from the competitive inhibition experiments with cold nucleotide substrates displayed in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> imply that AdsA binds AMP and ADP at a single site. Together these observations suggest that the two 5'-nucleotidase signature sequences of AdsA lie within close proximity of the nucleotide binding pocket in a unique spacial orientation that allows for the removal of both the &#x003b2;- and &#x003b1;-phosphates. Comparison of crystal structures from AdsA bound to AMP or ADP substrates is needed to further our understanding of AdsA's unique enzymatic activity; this is currently being pursued in the laboratory.</p><p>The ability to produce adenosine from multiple substrates provides a clear advantage for <italic>S. aureus </italic>in the fight against the host's immune system. Initiation of staphylococcal infections usually involve bacterial invasion of the skin or blood stream via trauma, surgical wounds, or medical devices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] and much is known about the mechanisms that <italic>S. aureus </italic>uses to combat the initial innate immune defense in the blood. Advanced <italic>S. aureus </italic>infection leads to dissemination of staphylococci into various tissues and formation of abscesses in organs. However, the molecular mechanisms of abscess formation during staphylococcal infections are not clearly understood but likely involve both pathogen and host response factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. The architecture of kidney abscesses observed in cross sections of kidneys collected from mice 5 days after staphylococcal infection shows a central staphylococci community surrounded by several distinct layers of infiltrating immune cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Closer examination of the abscesses in the histological images reveals a population of necrotic immune cells directly surrounding foci of bacteria, which likely encompasses a localized environment rich in cellular debris. As high concentrations of nucleotides are likely available as substrates for AdsA, <italic>S. aureus </italic>may be able to increase the abundance of adenosine to local concentrations that are even higher than those observed in blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In turn, the accumulation of adenosine may diminish the bactericidal attributes of infiltrating immune cells or alter the spectrum of immune cells that arrive at the abscess lesions. Furthermore, it has been shown that inflammatory microenvironments are significantly more acidic due to hypoxia and high levels of adenosine. AdsA's ADPase activity is retained at low pH (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>), an attribute that may be important in pathogenesis under these conditions. Consistent with these observations, we have shown that kidneys isolated from mice infected with wild-type <italic>S. aureus </italic>harbored higher number of abscesses as compared to mice infected with isogenic <italic>adsA </italic>variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p><italic>S. aureus </italic>is known to survive within the host for prolonged periods of time, however the mechanisms involved in such a lifestyle are not clearly known [reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]]. The conversion of GTP to GDP inside cells is critical to intracellular signaling events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] and the ability of staphylococci to hydrolyze GTP substrates may play a role in host intracellular survival, an area of investigation that we believe warrants further examination.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We show that in addition to its 5'-nucleotidase function, AdsA is functionally similar to NTPDase enzymes, owing to its ability to hydrolyze both ATP and ADP substrates. AdsA does not harbor any NTPDase ACR motifs and suggests that bacterial 5'-nucleotidases such as AdsA may harbor a unique active site. Comparative structural analyses between AdsA and NTPDases may enable the future design of inhibitors that block not only <italic>S. aureus </italic>AdsA but perhaps even the AdsA homologs from other bacterial pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AdsA: adenosine synthase A; NTPDase: nucleoside triphosphate diphosphorylase; ATP: adenosine triphosphate; ADP: adenosine diphosphate; AMP: adenosine monophosphate; Ado: adenosine; ACR: apyrase conserved regions; CD: cluster of differention; HSP: heat shock protein; TLC: thin layer chromatography; PCR: polymerase chain reaction; CD: circular dichroism; GTP: guanosine triphosphate; GDP: guanosine diphosphate; ITP: inosine triphosphate; IDP: inosine diphosphate.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>VT defined the concept and conducted the experiments of the study.
