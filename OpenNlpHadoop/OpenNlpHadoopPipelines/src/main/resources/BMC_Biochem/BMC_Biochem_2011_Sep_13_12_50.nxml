This is accomplished through direct protein interactions mediated by several structural domains conserved among all of the SRC family members. These domains include a basic helix-loop-helix Per/ARNT/SIM (bHLH-PAS) domain, a nuclear receptor interacting domain which consists of three leucine-rich motifs with the consensus amino acid sequence LxxLL (X = any amino acid and L = leucine), and two transcriptional activation domains (AD1 and AD2) within the carboxy terminus of SRC3. The AD1 domain interacts directly with various protein acetyltransferases such as CBP/p300, or p/CAF/GCN5 and is absolutely essential for SRC3-mediated transcriptional activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. A second transactivation domain (AD2) serves as an interaction surface for several members of the protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) class of enzymes such as the <underline>c</underline>oactivator <underline>a</underline>ssociated <underline>a</underline>rginine <underline>m</underline>ethyltransferase 1 (CARM1, also known as PRMT4) and PRMT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. CARM1 interacts directly with the AD2 domain of all the SRC proteins and co-transfection assays using transient or stably integrated reporter genes have shown that individual SRC proteins can synergize with p/300/CBP and CARM1 suggesting that the coordinated recruitment of acetyltransferases and methyltransferases by SRC3 may be complimentary to one another and represent essential activating steps in nuclear receptor-dependent gene transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>SRC3 function is also regulated by multiple cytoplasmic signalling events. Recent studies have identified numerous post-translational modifications within SRC3 such as phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination and methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Consequently, the type and specific sites of covalent modifications in SRC3 determine the affinity for the liganded-NR, as well the association with different coactivating partners, resulting in the formation of diverse multimeric complexes which are believed to regulate distinct gene expression programs.</p><p>SRC3 is located within a region of chromosome 20 that is often amplified in breast and ovarian cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Several studies have confirmed that SRC3 is amplified in a significant fraction of breast tumours, with amplification frequencies of approximately 10% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. A positive correlation has also been found between amplification of SRC3 and increased expression of the HER2 oncogene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Patients whose tumours expressed high levels of both p/CIP and HER-2 exhibited the poorest survival rates and the worst responses to tamoxifen therapy. In MCF-7 cells, downregulation of SRC3 using small interfering RNA (siRNA) decreased &#x003b2;estradiol-dependent cell proliferation and inhibited expression of several ER&#x003b1; targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Importantly, decreased expression of SRC3 in MCF-7 cells is associated with a significant reduction in estrogen-dependent colony formation and tumour growth in nude mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Collectively, these results suggest that SRC3 is required for maximum ER activation, and amplification and overexpression of SRC3 is a contributing factor that promotes ER-dependent signalling in the mammary gland and in breast cancer. Transgenic mice overexpressing SRC3 under the control of the MMTV promoter have provided further evidence for its oncogenic capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The mammary glands of SRC3 transgenic mice were associated with increases in cell proliferation, reduced apoptosis and a high tumour incidence. Furthermore, increases in IGF-I mRNA levels and activation of IGF/AKT/mTOR signalling pathway were also found in the mammary gland tumours.</p><p>In the present study, we purified SRC3 from Hela cell nuclear extracts and using mass spectrometry, we have identified the DNA damage response protein 53BP1 as a novel SRC3-associated protein. The colocalization of SRC3 and 53BP1 also included CBP based on copurification, and was restricted to the nuclear compartment. Colocalization of SRC3 and 53BP1 was not dependent on DNA damage suggesting that SRC3 likely plays no direct role in the DNA damage response. However, using both chromatin immunorecipitation (ChIP) and siRNA knockdown, we have determined that SRC3 and 53BP1 co-occupy the same region of the BRCA1 promoter and are both required for BRCA1 expression in Hela cells. These results suggest that the 53BP1/SRC3 complex may play a role in modulating the DNA damage response by regulating the expression of a subset of target genes important for DNA repair.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>To purify SRC3-associated proteins we combined conventional and immunoaffinity chromatography using an &#x003b1;SRC3 antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). HeLa cell nuclear extracts were prepared and fractionated on a P11 phosphocellulose column using a buffer containing increasing salt concentrations. Western blot analysis of the eluates derived from the P11 column indicated that SRC3 eluted in buffer containing 0.1 M KCl (data not shown). The SRC3-containing fraction was then subjected to further purification using gel filtration chromatography followed by affinity purification using an &#x003b1; SRC3 antibody crosslinked to Protein A Sepharose (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). SDS-PAGE analysis followed by silver staining detected several other proteins ranging in molecular weight from 43 to 350 kDa (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). The identity of SRC3-associated proteins was found to vary between different purifications with the exception of the band migrating at approximately 300 kDa which was consistently observed in all of the independent purifications performed and was identified by mass spectrometry as the DNA damage response protein p53 <underline>b</underline>inding <underline>p</underline>rotein 1 (53BP1). To confirm our mass spectrometry findings, western blotting was performed using various antibodies which demonstrated that SRC3, 53BP1 and the SRC3-interacting protein Creb binding protein (CBP) were specifically retained by the &#x003b1;SRC3 affinity column (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Purification of SRC3 from HeLa cell nuclear extracts</bold>.

Fractionation of HeLa cell nuclear extracts by phosphocellulose chromatography demonstrated that 53BP1 was found in both the 0.1 M and 0.3 M salt fractions suggesting that 53BP1 may be found as a constituent of other protein complexes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The 0.1 M KCl fraction, containing both SRC3 and 53BP1, was then subjected to further purification using gel filtration chromatography. Elution from the gel filtration column indicated that 53BP1 migrated with an estimated molecular mass of approximately to 1 to 2 MDa and partially overlapped with the elution profile of SRC3(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). The fractions containing both 53BP1 and SRC3 were pooled and purified by affinity chromatography using the &#x003b1;53BP1 antibody crosslinked to protein A Sepharose. Western blotting of the affinity purified fractions using specific antibodies demonstrated that this 53BP1 fraction also contained SRC3 and CBP confirming that they are most likely found in the same complex (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). To determine if 53BP1 was able to interact directly with SRC3, deletion mutants of various region of 53BP1 were generated by <italic>in vitro </italic>transcription and translation with [<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine and tested for interaction with purified recombinant SRC3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). These experiments indicated that the carboxy terminus of 53BP1, containing the BRCT domains, interacted with full length SRC3, and a weaker interaction was detected with the region corresponding to (aa 950-1303). These results suggest that the carboxy terminus of 53BP1 makes direct contact with full length SRC3.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Purification of 53BP1 from HeLa nuclear extracts</bold>.

When cells are exposed to agents which induce DNA double stranded breaks such as etoposide, 53BP1 rapidly relocalizes to discrete foci within the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. To define the potential role of the SRC3 in the DNA-damage response pathway, we investigated the effects of DNA damage on the localization of SRC3. For these experiments, Hela cells were treated with etoposide for 30 minutes, and the cells were allowed to recover, fixed and stained for either SRC3 or 53BP1. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, in asynchronously proliferating HeLa cells both SRC3 and 53BP1 appear to be homogenously distributed throughout the nucleus. Upon treatment with 10 nM etoposide for 30 minutes, 53BP1 becomes localized to discrete foci. In contrast, the distribution of SRC3 remained unchanged when comparing the etoposide treated cells to the control cells. Distribution was also examined following gamma(&#x003b3;) irradiation which again demonstrated that 53BP1 becomes localized to multiple foci whereas the distribution of SRC3 in the nucleus was homogenous (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Interestingly, some colocalization was evident at the 53BP1-containing foci when the images are merged. However, we believe that this is most likely not the result of an SRC3 response to the DNA damage because we did not observe any redistribution of SRC following treatment with etoposide. Furthermore, immunoaffinity purification of SRC3 indicated that 53BP1 copurifies with SRC3 regardless of whether the DNA had been damaged (data not shown). We also examined a potential regulatory role of SRC3 in the 53BP1-dependent response to etoposide following SRC3 knockdown. SRC3 levels were downregulated using siRNA and cells were treated with etoposide for 30 minutes then allowed to recover for various periods of time and foci formation were again monitored. Foci formation was clearly evident 30 minutes after etoposide treatment and the number of foci decreased in a time-dependent fashion (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Importantly, SRC3 knockdown using siRNA had no significant effect on the rate of recovery following etoposide treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). These results suggest that SRC3 is most likely not involved in the initial response to DNA damage.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Localization of 53BP1 and SRC3 in response to DNA damage</bold>.

Recent studies have shown that a 53BP1-containing complex binds to an imperfect palindromic sequence found in the BRCA1 minimal promoter, and depletion of 53BP1 using siRNA suppresses both the activity of a reporter containing the minimal promoter and BRCA1 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. To determine if 53BP1 and SRC3 bind to a similar region of the BRCA1 promoter, we performed ChIP analysis in HeLa cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). Both SRC3 and 53BP1 are enriched within the proximal promoter that contains the 53BP1 binding site described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Finally, to assess if SRC3 or 53BP1 regulate BRCA1 protein expression, we used siRNA to knockdown SRC3 or 53BP1 in Hela cells. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, knockdown of 53BP1 or SRC3 resulted in significant decreases in BRCA1 protein levels suggesting that both proteins are required for expression of the BRCA1 gene. Collectively, these results suggest that the association between SRC3/53BP1 may represent a functional complex involved in transcriptional regulation of specific genes involved in DNA repair.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>ChIP analysis of of the BRCA1 promoter</bold>.

Silver staining of the affinity purified SRC3 complex detected at least 10 additional proteins; although the reproducibility of many of the purified proteins was not always consistent, they did not coelute from control antibody affinity columns. Therefore, we believe that they may play a complimentary role to SRC3 in response to specific stimuli. SRC3 belongs to the SRC family of proteins which function primarily as adaptor proteins involved in the recruitment and stabilization of protein complexes to upstream regulatory regions. Immunoaffinity chromatography has previously been used to identify a number of SRC-interacting proteins that include protein kinases, chromatin modifying proteins such as CBP/p300 as well as additional adaptor proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. While 53BP1 has not been previously identified as a SRC3-associated protein, many of the previous studies have used immunoaffinity purification using antibodies raised against different epitopes of SRC3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Consequently, it is conceivable that a specific protein-antibody interaction could result in masking specific interaction domains, or disrupt specific interactions, resulting in the purification of a different repertoire of interacting proteins.</p><p>Targeting protein acetyltransferases to specific sites in the genome has been shown to play an important role in double strand breaks (DSB) repair. The TRAP and TIP60 histone acetyltransferases are recruited to DSB and are required for H4 acetylation as well as the recruitment of additional DSB mediators including 53BP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. More recently, both CBP and p300 have been shown to play an important role in acetylation of histone H3 and H4 at DSB sites during non homologous end joining (NHEJ) which in turn facilitates recruitment of the SWI/SNF complex and consequently causing the chromatin to assume a more relaxed conformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Interestingly, both CBP and p300 have been found to associate with proteins involved in DNA repair and DNA damage response pathways, including 53BP1, suggesting that chromatin modification is a necessary prerequisite for the maintenance of genome integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Finally, recent studies have implicated 53BP1 in NHEJ and V9(D)J recombination through a mechanism involving changes in chromatin mobility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>Based on our fractionation studies using 53BP1 antibody, 53BP1 consistently cofractionated into 2 distinct protein complexes following P11 chromatography. One complex eluted at a lower salt concentration contained both SRC3 and CBP, and a second complex which eluted at a higher salt concentration and does not contain SRC3 (data not shown). 53BP1 was first identified in a screen for p53-interacting proteins and was initially characterized as a coactivator of p53-dependent transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. 53BP1 contains tandem C-terminal BRCT motifs. Although the exact function of 53BP1 remains somewhat ambiguous it is believed to act as a scaffold or adaptor protein that coordinates DNA repair by facilitating recruitment of additional proteins required in the DNA repair process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Mice deficient in 53BP1 exhibit a number of pleiotropic abnormalities including growth and immune deficiencies, extreme sensitivity to radiation and are cancer prone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Importantly, cells from 53BP1-deficient mice exhibit intrinsic defects in genomic stability indicating that 53BP1 is a tumour suppressor protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. When cells are exposed to genotoxic insults that cause DNA double stranded breaks, 53BP1 becomes localized to discrete nuclear foci which appear with varying degrees of rapidity and colocalize, in part, with other known components of the DNA damage response pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. The region of 53BP1 required for focal recruitment has been mapped to amino acids 1220-1711 and encompasses tandem tudor domains. The tudor domain has been shown to interact with methylated lysines and arginines and suggests that recruitment of 53BP1 to chromatin during DSB may proceed through multiple histone modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. For example the tudor domain of 53BP1 has been shown to interact with dimethylated H3K79 and H4K20 and studies have demonstrated a prerequisite for H3K79 dimethylation in the DNA damage response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Interestingly, SRC3 is methylated by CARM1 <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, the region of 53BP1 that interacts with SRC3 contains the BRCT domains, not the tudor domains so it is unlikely that the association between 53BP1 and SRC3 is methylation dependent.</p><p>We did not find any evidence for a direct role for SRC3 in the DNA damage response, based on immunoflourescence analysis. While 53BP1 clearly relocalized to discrete foci in response to etoposide treatment, the distribution of SRC3 remained ubiquitous although some colocalization was observed within the foci following treatment with &#x003b3; irradiation. Furthermore, knockdown of SRC3 using siRNA had no significant effect on the recovery rate following short term treatment with etoposide. While we cannot fully exclude a role for SRC3, based on this assay we believe that SRC3 is unlikely to play a direct role in the initial response to DNA damage. However, we have not examined other DSB mechanisms such as NHEJ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. In addition, there may be a level of redundancy with other SRC proteins which may compensate for any effect SRC3 may have in DNA damage response.</p><p>Our data suggests that 53BP1 plays a role in gene regulation and that the association between SRC3 and 53BP1 may be important for modulating the transcriptional response of the BRCA1 gene. A recent study has provided supporting evidence for this mechanism as 53BP1 may directly regulate gene transcription by targeting the BRCA1 promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In vitro gel shift analysis has demonstrated that a 53BP1-containing complex binds to a consensus binding site found within the proximal promoter region of BRCA1 and ChIP analysis has shown that 53BP1 is targeted to the BRCA1 promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Furthermore, depletion of endogenous 53BP1 in U2OS cells is associated with decreased BRCA1 mRNA and protein expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. We have shown in Hela cells that both 53BP1 and SRC3 are found within the same approximate region of the BRCA1 promoter based on ChIP analysis. Importantly, downregulation of SRC3 or 53BP1 resulted in a similar loss of BRCA1 expression in HeLa cells.</p><p>The BRCA1 gene is a tumour suppressor that plays an essential role in multiple functions including DNA repair and transcriptional regulation and is regulated by a complex network of DNA binding proteins and coactivators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Germline mutations in BRCA1 are relatively rare in sporadic forms of breast cancer although deregulation in BRCA1 expression is common [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. In the majority of these cases the BRCA1 promoter is not hypermethylated suggesting that altered transcriptional regulation of the BRCA1 gene may play a causal role in this type of cancer. Upregulation of BRCA1 expression has also been shown to occur in response to 17&#x003b2;-estradiol in various breast cancer cell lines and in overectimized mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], and BRCA1 levels increase during puberty and pregnancy when estradiol levels peak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Furthermore, treatment of MCF7 breast cancer cells with 17&#x003b2;-estradiol results in recruitment of ER&#x003b1; and p300 to the BRCA1 promoter that is, in part, mediated by AP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. It is well established that SRC3 interacts with both the ligand-bound ER and p300 with high affinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Thus, while we have not mapped the BRCA1 binding sites in detail, it is conceivable that in some cell types SRC3 and 53BP1 are recruited to the BRCA1 promoter as part of a larger complex involving the ER and as well as other transcription factors.</p><p>Although the biological significance of our findings remains to be elucidated, BRCA1 expression is regulated in a cell cycle dependent manner with the induction of BRCA1 peaking before the onset of DNA replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Consequently increases in BRCA1 expression resulting from SRC3 overexpression in some breast cancers may lead to aberrant activation of S-phase checkpoint proteins such as p53.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>SRC3 and 53BP1 are part of a complex which targets the BRCA1 gene promoter. Furthermore, both SRC3 and 53BP1 are required for BRCA1 expression suggesting that the SRC3/53BP1 complex plays a role in DNA damage by regulating the activity of a subset of target genes involved in DNA repair.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Antibodies and Reagents</title><p>The antibody to SRC3 was generated from a His-tagged recombinant protein and has been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The antibody to 53BP1 was generated from a His-tagged recombinant protein which was generated by digesting a cDNA plasmid containing the human 53BP1 protein with Bam HI and MScI and the corresponding fragment was subcloned into PQE31 vector (Qiagen). The plasmid was then transformed into M15 bacterial cells grown to an OD of approximately 0.7 and protein production by adding 0.5 mM IPTG. The recombinant protein was then purified using Ni-Agarose according to the manufacturers instructions (Qiagen) and was subsequently injected into rabbits for antibody production. The SRC3 and 53BP1 antibodies were purified by affinity chromatography using Protein A Sepharose according to standard procedures. All other antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The siRNA used in this study was obtained from Dharmacon. The siRNA against 53BP1 was GCCAGGUUCUAGAGGAUGAdTdT. Knockdown of SRC3 was performed using the SMART pool siRNA J-003759. The primers used for PCR analysis of the BRCA1 promoter were as follows, forward: GCCATTGATTGGTGGAGATT (-846), reverse: CGAGTCTCGGGCAAGTAGTC (-662), and the BRCA1 upstream primers were as follows, forward: TGCAACACACCCAGAGTACC) (-7536) and reverse: TTGCATTGTTCTGACCACCA (-7406).</p></sec><sec><title>Purification of SRC3 and 53BP1</title><p>For small scale scale purifications, HeLa cells were typically grown on 150 mm dishes to 80% confluency prior to harvesting.
