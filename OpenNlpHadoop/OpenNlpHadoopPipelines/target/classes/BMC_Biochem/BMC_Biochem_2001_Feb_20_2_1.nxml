In this study we have examined the influence of plasma lipases and lipid transfer protein activities on the transfer of free cholesterol (FC) and phospholipids (PL) from lipid emulsion to human, rat and mouse lipoproteins. The effect of the lipases was verified by incubation of labeled (<sup>3</sup>H-FC,<sup>14</sup>C-PL) triglyceride rich emulsion with human plasma (control, post-heparin and post-heparin plus lipase inhibitor), rat plasma (control and post-heparin) and by the injection of the labeled lipid emulsion into control and heparinized functionally hepatectomized rats.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In vitro, the lipase enriched plasma stimulated significantly the transfer of <sup>14</sup>C-PL from emulsion to high density lipoprotein (p&#x0003c;0.001) but did not modify the transfer of <sup>3</sup>H-FC. In hepatectomized rats, heparin stimulation of intravascular lipolysis increased the plasma removal of <sup>14</sup>C-PL and the amount of <sup>14</sup>C-PL found in the low density lipoprotein density fraction but not in the high density lipoprotein density fraction. The in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that free cholesterol and phospholipids were transferred from lipid emulsion to plasma lipoproteins independently from each other. The incubation of human plasma, control and control plus monoclonal antibody anti-cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), with <sup>14</sup>C-PL emulsion showed that CETP increases <sup>14</sup>C-PL transfer to human HDL, since its partial inhibition by the anti-CETP antibody reduced significantly the <sup>14</sup>C-PL transfer (p&#x0003c;0.05). However, comparing the nontransgenic (no CETP activity) with the CETP transgenic mouse plasma, no effect of CETP on the <sup>14</sup>C-PL distribution in mice lipoproteins was observed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>It is concluded that: 1-intravascular lipases stimulate phospholipid transfer protein mediated phospholipid transfer, but not free cholesterol, from triglyceride rich particles to human high density lipoproteins and rat low density lipoproteins and high density lipoproteins; 2-free cholesterol and phospholipids are transferred from triglyceride rich particles to plasma lipoproteins by distinct mechanisms, and 3 - CETP also contributes to phospholipid transfer activity in human plasma but not in transgenic mice plasma, a species which has high levels of the specific phospholipid transfer protein activity.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>There have been plenty of epidemiological, clinical and experimental evidence that plasma high density lipoproteins levels are inversely correlated with the risk of atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The contribution of enzymes and proteins associated with HDL to its process of generation and maturation have been extensively studied, both in vitro and in vivo.</p><p>The plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) modulates HDL levels and composition. It mediates the transfer of cholesteryl ester (CE) from HDL to triglyceride (TG) rich lipoproteins (LP), while TG is transferred in the opposite direction, to HDL. One way CE transfer from HDL to LDL may also occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. CETP also promotes phospholipid (PL) transfer to human HDL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. CETP activity has been directly correlated with LDL cholesterol levels and inversely correlated with HDL cholesterol levels in human plasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>PLTP, a specific phospholipid transfer protein, has been identified in human plasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and in plasma of other vertebrate species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. It promotes the PL transfer from VLDL to HDL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In addition to PL, PLTP transfers free cholesterol (FC) from PL/FC vesicles to HDL, although with a low efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Both, CETP and PLTP, can promote HDL remodelling. While CETP, together with hepatic lipoprotein lipase, stimulates the generation of small alpha-HDL, PLTP favours the emergence of large alpha-HDL particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Significantly higher levels of HDL-cholesterol were observed in human PLTP transgenic mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Furthermore, overexpression of human PLTP produced by recombinant adenovirus injection into mice, resulted in increased levels of prebeta-HDL, increased fractional catabolic rate and liver uptake of CE and PL from HDL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>After intravascular hydrolysis of TG rich LP by lipoprotein lipase (LPL), surface remnant components such as FC, PL and apoproteins may provide substrates for generation or modification of plasma HDL. Net transfer of PL and FC from chylomicrons and VLDL to HDL has previously been demonstrated in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and in human plasma after a fat meal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] or during lipolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The contribution of the lipolysed LP components to HDL formation has been reinforced by several studies where the activity of the enzyme lipoprotein lipase LPL was shown to correlate with HDL cholesterol levels in human plasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. However, changes in the HDL-cholesterol concentration have not been observed in mice overexpressing LPL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] or in LPL heterozygous knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>The metabolism of HDL in rats and mice differs significantly from that in humans. Part of the species differences observed in mice and in rats may result from their high levels of circulating lipases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], lack of CETP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and high levels of PLTP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Clee et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] have shown that, in double transgenic mice overexpressing LPL and CETP, HDL cholesterol levels were significantly influenced by the LPL activity while no such correlation was observed in the absence of CETP expression.</p><p>In this study we have further evaluated the influence of plasma lipases and CETP on the free cholesterol and phospholipid transfer from triglyceride rich lipid emulsion similar to chylomicrons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] to human, rat and mouse lipoproteins, <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The influence of the intravascular lipase activity on the phospholipids (PL) and free cholesterol (FC) transfer from lipid emulsion (EM) to plasma lipoproteins was evaluated in human control plasma, in lipase-enriched post-heparin plasma and in post-heparin plasma containing a lipase inhibitor, tetrahydrolipstatin (THL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. PL transfer was determined after 30 minutes of incubation because Tall et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] have demonstrated that PL net transfer reaches the maximum after this incubation period. The post-heparin plasma lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and hepatic lipoprotein lipase (HL) activities were 2527 &#x000b1; 1353 and 3747 &#x000b1; 2116 nmol of fatty acid/ml/h, respectively. The control and post-heparin + THL plasmas had no detectable lipase activity, showing that 2 mM THL completely inhibited the activities of the lipases present in the post-heparin plasma. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> shows that <sup>14</sup>C-PL was preferentially transferred to HDL (p&#x0003c;0.001) while <sup>3</sup>H-FC was equally distributed to LDL and HDL fractions under all 3 plasma conditions. The transfer of <sup>14</sup>C-PL from EM to HDL was significantly stimulated (+60%) by the increase in the lipases' activities in the post-heparin plasma (p&#x0003c;0.001). This stimulation of the PL transfer was abolished in the presence of THL (p&#x0003c;0.01). Considering that HL also has phospholipase activity, the integrity of the phospholipid transferred to HDL was checked by thin layer chromatography. Ninety eight % of the <sup>14</sup>C-PL was recovered in the PL band and no radioactivity was detected in the fatty acid bands. The proportion of <sup>3</sup>H-FC and <sup>14</sup>C-PL found in HDL (0.4) was different from that found in LDL (2.3) or in the EM (1.5), which suggests that these components of the EM were independently transferred to the LP fractions and not as a surface unit detached from the lipolysed EM.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Influence of plasma lipases on the <sup>3</sup>H-free cholesterol (FC) and <sup>14</sup>C-phospholipid (PL) transfer from lipid emulsions to the human plasma lipoproteins.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">Fractions</td><td align="left">Control</td><td align="left"></td><td align="left">Post-heparin</td><td align="left">Post-heparin +</td><td align="left">THL</td><td align="left"></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td></td><td align="left"><sup>3</sup>H-FC</td><td align="left"><sup>14</sup>C-PL</td><td align="left"><sup>3</sup>H-FC</td><td align="left"><sup>14</sup>C-PL</td><td align="left"><sup>3</sup>H-FC</td><td align="left"><sup>14</sup>C-PL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="7"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">LDL</td><td align="left">15</td><td align="left">7</td><td align="left">21</td><td align="left">7</td><td align="left">20</td><td align="left">6</td></tr><tr><td align="left"></td><td align="left">(2-35)</td><td align="left">(3-49)</td><td align="left">(15-26)</td><td align="left">(2-13)</td><td align="left">(17-34)</td><td align="left">(1-12)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">HDL</td><td align="left">13</td><td align="left">31<sup>a</sup></td><td align="left">18</td><td align="left">50<sup>a,b</sup></td><td align="left">15</td><td align="left">39<sup>a,c</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left"></td><td align="left">(7-28)</td><td align="left">(18-47)</td><td align="left">(12-36)</td><td align="left">(35-68)</td><td align="left">(8-33)</td><td align="left">(23-48)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Percent transfer of <sup>3</sup>H-FC and <sup>14</sup>C-PL from lipid emulsion to LDL and HDL obtained from fasting human plasma control, post-heparin with and without addition of a lipase inhibitor, tetrahydrolipstatin (THL) incubated for 30 minutes at zero (ice) and at 37&#x000b0;C.

Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> shows the <sup>14</sup>C-PL distribution in the LP fractions at zero (ice) or after 30 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C. In the control rat plasma (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, upper panel) at time zero, the distribution of <sup>14</sup>C-PL was 60, 13, 22 and 6% for VLDL, LDL, HDL and a fraction smaller than HDL (&#x0003c;HDL), respectively, while after 30 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C, the observed distribution was 22, 14, 57 and 8% for VLDL, LDL, HDL and fraction &#x0003c;HDL, respectively. It is interesting that PL transfer to HDL can be observed even at time zero. This may represent the combination of the spontaneous and facilitated transfer that occurs during and even after loading the reaction mixture to the FPLC column run at room temperature. Furthermore, rat plasma contains circulating lipases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] that could be stimulating PL transfer in the control plasma. In the rat post-heparin plasma (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, lower panel), the <sup>14</sup>C-PL transfer was so much accelerated that the distributions at zero and after 30 minutes of incubation at 37&#x000b0;C were almost identical, that is, 12, 29.5, 32.5 and 26.5% at zero and 7, 31, 29.5 and 32.5% at 37&#x000b0;C for VLDL, LDL, HDL and fraction &#x0003c;HDL, respectively. HDL and the fraction smaller than HDL together accounted for 59 to 62% of the <sup>14</sup>C-PL. Thus, comparing the PL moiety that remained in the emulsion fraction in the control at 37&#x000b0;C (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> upper, 22%) with the post-heparin plasma at 37&#x000b0;C (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> lower, 7%), we conclude that PL transfer to LDL and HDL fractions is highly stimulated by the enrichment of the rat plasma with the vascular lipases. We did not investigate the chemical nature of the fraction smaller than HDL but we speculate that it derives from HDL phospholipids or from the emulsion surface itself, and might be lysophospholipids/albumin or phospholipids/apo AI complexes.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Influence of plasma lipases on the distribution of the <sup>14</sup>C-PL from lipid emulsions into rat plasma lipoproteins.

The liver exclusion maneuver was done in order to minimize the differences in the residence time of the emulsion particles in the circulation of the control and LPL stimulated rats. The hepatectomy efficacy was verified by the amount of <sup>3</sup>H-PL found in the livers at the end of the experiments; that was 1% and 3% of the injected dose in control and heparinized animals, respectively. There was a lower recovery of the labeled PL in the plasma of the heparinized animals (&#x0223c; 50%) than in control rats (&#x0223c; 90%). This suggests that the heparin stimulated lipolysis increased the plasma removal of PL by peripheral tissues. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> shows the distribution of <sup>3</sup>H-PL and <sup>14</sup>C-FC from the EM into the plasma LP of control and heparinized hepatectomized rats. When intravascular lipolysis was stimulated by heparin, there was a 50% reduction of the <sup>3</sup>H-PL content in the chylomicron (CM) + VLDL fraction (d&#x0003c;1.006) and a parallel increase in the LDL fraction that also includes remnant particles (d= 1.006 to 1.063). No significant difference was observed in the amount of <sup>3</sup>H-PL found in the HDL fraction of control and heparinized hepatectomized rats. A similar result was observed in relation to the <sup>14</sup>C-FC distribution, i.e., a reduction trend of <sup>14</sup>C-FC in the CM+VLDL fraction (non significant) and a significant increase of <sup>14</sup>C-FC transfer to the LDL fraction. However, in both cases, control and heparinized animals, the ratio <sup>14</sup>C-FC/<sup>3</sup>H-PL differs markedly in the three LP fractions (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). This indicates that, in vivo, the redistribution of the two emulsion surface lipids is independent one from another.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Influence of plasma lipases on the distribution of <sup>14</sup>C-free cholesterol (FC) and <sup>3</sup>H-phospholipid (PL) from lipid emulsions to plasma lipoproteins of hepatectomized rats in vivo.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">Fractions</td><td align="left" colspan="2">Control</td><td align="left" colspan="2">Heparinized</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan="4"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left"><sup>14</sup>C-FC</td><td align="left"><sup>3</sup>H-PL</td><td align="left"><sup>14</sup>C-FC</td><td align="left"><sup>3</sup>H-PL</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">CM+ VLDL</td><td align="left">61</td><td align="left">36</td><td align="left">47</td><td align="left">16<sup>a</sup></td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">(53 - 74)</td><td align="left">(27 - 61)</td><td align="left">(43 - 55)</td><td align="left">(14 - 22)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">LDL + remnants</td><td align="left">20</td><td align="left">22</td><td align="left">34<sup>b</sup></td><td align="left">38<sup>c</sup></td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">(11 - 24)</td><td align="left">(10 - 26)</td><td align="left">(29 - 38)</td><td align="left">(33 - 42)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">HDL</td><td align="left">19</td><td align="left">42</td><td align="left">18</td><td align="left">46</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">(15 - 23)</td><td align="left">(29 - 47)</td><td align="left">(14 - 22)</td><td align="left">(40 - 51)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Percent distribution of <sup>14</sup>C-FC and <sup>3</sup>H-PL from lipid emulsion to VLDL, LDL and HDL plasma fractions from anesthetized hepatectomized rats treated with saline (control) or heparin after 30 minutes of an intra-arterial injection of the labeled emulsion.

The present work has confirmed and extended previous observations showing that human and rat plasma lipoprotein lipases stimulate PLTP mediated PL transfer from TG-rich particles to HDL but do not influence the FC transfer process. Some of the previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] that used purified exogenous lipases in in vitro incubations with isolated LP displayed a potent stimulation of the PL transfer to HDL. In order to prepare a model that would mirror a physiological system more closely, we have used whole plasma and maximal endogenous lipases activity through heparin administration in vivo as well as in vitro. It is possible that other proteins released by heparin in the vascular bed may have played a role in stimulating PL transfer. The role of circulating lipases was confirmed through the use of a lipase inhibitor (THL), which abolished the stimulating effect of lipase-enriched plasma on the PL transfer to HDL (Tab. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). According to these experiments it is likely that during fasting state, where no circulating lipases are detectable, all PL transfer results from the action of the lipid transfer proteins, PLTP and CETP, while in a post-prandial state, when lipases expectedly are more active, the PL transfer to HDL could be raised by 60% or more due to a greater substrate supply .</p><p>Noteworthy the in vitro PL transfer to HDL in the basal plasmas of rat (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, 82%) and mouse (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, 57%) was higher than in the human's (Tab. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, 31%) and could be ascribed to the high levels of circulating lipases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and PLTP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] found in those species. This could also explain the positive correlation between the lipoprotein lipase activity and HDL concentration in human plasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] but not in mice with genetically modified expression of LPL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>The in vivo studies showed that the EM PL transfer to HDL did not differ in control and in LPL stimulated (heparin treated) hepatectomized rats. Instead, the LDL density fraction was PL enriched in the heparinized animals. This could be explained by several and not exclusive possibilities. First, the lipolysis stimulation by heparin generates more remnants of the EM that would float in the same density range as LDL (1.006 - 1.063). Second, the rat plasma fraction smaller than HDL that appeared in the in vitro incubations with post-heparin plasma (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) could also occur in vivo and float in the same density range as LDL (1.006 -1.063). In this regard, O'Meara et. al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] had shown that small HDL particles from heparinized hypertriglyceridemic subjects, identified in non-denaturing gel electrophoresis and by electron microscopy, floated after ultracentrifugation in a less dense range. Those authors had considered it an aberrant result of the ultracentrifugation technique. Third, the diminished availability of PL donor particles in the plasma of the heparinized rats (yield of 50%) as compared to control rats (yield of 90%) would be responsible for the apparent lack of stimulation of the PL transfer to the HDL fraction. Finally, other in vivo metabolic fates of PL would compete for the transfer process to plasma HDL particles in LPL stimulated animals.</p><p>The emulsion FC transfer to HDL was about 40% that of PL in both, in vitro (Tab. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) and in vivo (Tab. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>) studies and it was not influenced by increased rate of intravascular lipolysis. These results suggest that the FC transfer is a slower, probably passive, process distinct from the facilitated PL transfer mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Also, these results challenge the possibility that new HDL particles are made from the EM surface peeling off during lipolysis because the relative PL/FC ratio was higher in HDL than in the CM+VLDL and emulsion fraction. Others also have shown that FC transfer to HDL is a slow process: FC increases in the HDL fraction only 5 to 8 h after a fat meal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] or only after 2 h incubation of HDL with VLDL and purified rat heart LPL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>We have also confirmed previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] claiming that PL transfer from TG-rich particles to human HDL is facilitated by CETP, since its partial inhibition significantly reduced the PL transfer (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). However, human CETP expressed in the transgenic mice plasma had no effect whatsoever on the PL transfer to mouse plasma lipoproteins or to human HDL. This lead us to admit that the mouse plasma PL transfer activity is so potent that some additional protein (CETP) with PL transfer activity would be irrelevant in an already saturated in vitro system.</p><p>In summary, the present findings indicate unequivocally the importance of the intravascular lipolytic mechanisms for the PLTP and CETP facilitated PL, but not FC, transfer process from TG-rich particles to HDL. PL enriched HDL would be more efficient in promoting FC efflux from cell membranes, hence accelerating the reverse cholesterol transport. These may provide the basis for the mechanism that accounts for the inverse correlation between HDL and TG plasma levels found in epidemiological studies in human populations as well as in several circumstances where plasma lipid levels are modified by pharmacological and dietary means.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Lipid emulsions</title><p>Cholesterol (FC), cholesteryl oleate (CO) and triolein (TO) were obtained from NuCheck Prep (Elysian, MN, USA) and lecithin (PL) from Lipid Products (Surrey,UK).
