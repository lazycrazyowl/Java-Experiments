During post translational processing these elements excise themselves out of the host protein (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] for recent reviews). The sequences removed during splicing are called inteins (short for internal protein); the portions of the host protein are termed exteins (external protein) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Inteins facilitate their excision out of the host protein without the help of any known host specific activity. This phenomenon, called protein splicing, was first discovered about a decade ago in the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> V-ATPase catalytic subunit A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Intein excision depends on the splicing domain of the intein and the first amino acid residue of the C-extein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The inteins known to date are between 134 and 608 amino acids long, and they have been reported from all three domains of life: eukaryotes, eubacteria and archaea. Pietrokovski's webpage on inteins <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://blocks.fhcrc.org/~pietro/inteins/"/> currently lists more than 100 inteins in 34 different types of proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The host proteins are diverse in function, including metabolic enzymes, DNA and RNA polymerases, gyrases, proteases, ribonucleotide reductases, and vacuolar and archaeal type ATPases. Common features suggested for these proteins are their expression during DNA replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and their low substitution rate during evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Most reported inteins are composed of two domains: one is responsible for protein splicing, and the other has endonuclease activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The function of the endonuclease is to spread the intein to intein-free homologs of the host protein. During this process, called homing, the gene encoding the intein-free homolog is cleaved by the endonuclease at or close to the intein integration site. During the repair of the cleaved gene, the intein is copied to the previously intein-free homolog. Gimble and Thorner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] demonstrated intein homing in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> using engineered V-ATPase genes from which the intein encoding portion had been previously removed. However, some inteins lack the endonuclease domain. Inteins without this domain perform autocatalytic splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Homing endonucleases and the process of homing have been more intensively studied in self splicing introns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and the process is assumed to be similar for inteins.</p><p><italic>Thermoplasma acidophilum</italic> is among sixteen archaea for which inteins have been reported to date (Intein database <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.neb.com/inteins/int_reg.html"/>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]). Members of the genus <italic>Thermoplasma</italic> lack cell walls and possess a cytoskeleton. They live in hot and acidic environments, and are often found adhering to sulfur particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. <italic>T. acidophilum</italic> grows optimally at 59&#x000b0;C and at an external pH between 1&#x02013;2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. A cytoplasmic pH of 5.5 has been measured indirectly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Proton pumping ATPases/ATPsynthases are found in all groups of present day organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The typical archaeal ATPsynthase is homologous to the eukaryotic vacuolar ATPase. Because of the high degree of sequence similarity the archaeal ATP synthase (A-type ATPase) is sometimes labeled as vacuolar or V-type ATPase. The archaeal and the vacuolar ATPase are both homologous to the bacterial F-ATPases, but the level of sequence similarity with the F-ATPases is much lower than between the V- and the A-ATPases. To date seven species have been identified to harbor inteins in their ATPase catalytic subunits. The first intein was discovered in the <italic>vma</italic>-1 gene of <italic>Saccharomyces</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The yeast <italic>Candida tropicalis</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] possesses an intein in the same location. Inteins are also present in the A subunit of the A-type ATPases of <italic>Thermoplasma acidophilum, T. volcanium, Pyrococcus abysii, P. horikoshii</italic> and <italic>P. furiosus.</italic></p><p>Here we present data on the cloning and expression of the <italic>T. acidophilum</italic> A-ATPase A subunit in <italic>E. coli,</italic> and we discuss implications for the location, propagation and distribution of inteins among organisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Sequence analysis of the <italic>T. acidophilum</italic> intein</title><p>The <italic>T. acidophilum</italic> intein was discovered while sequencing the catalytic subunit of the archaeal ATPase/ATPsynthase from <italic>T. acidophilum</italic> for systematic purposes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].

In both instances, the catalytic subunit of the ATPsynthase is the only gene in the entire genome for which an intein was reported. Using PSI-BLAST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] with different inteins as seeds, divergent inteins with less than ten percent sequence identity as compared to the query sequence are recovered (data not shown); however, using this approach we did not discover any additional intein or homing endonuclease encoding genes in <italic>T. acidophilum.</italic></p><p>Multiple sequence alignments of diverse intein sequences identified eight motifs composed of moderately conserved residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].

The P-value for this match, i.e. the probability of obtaining a match of this quality by chance alone, was calculated to be below 10<sup>-10</sup>. This indicates that not only the exteins, but also the inteins themselves are recognizably homologous. In contrast, a sequence alignment of all known inteins shows intein sequences to be much more divergent (not shown).

The production of tRNAs corresponds to the frequencies with which the different codons are present in their protein coding genes. The exact causes for tRNA regulation and codon usage are not completely understood; however, expression of foreign genes in an organism is often prevented by a different codon usage of the foreign gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Many Archaea have codon usage frequencies and tRNA compositions different from <italic>E. coli.</italic> The <italic>T. acidophilum</italic> A-ATPase A subunit has 763 codons. Codon AUA (Ile) is the most frequent (39/1000). In <italic>E. coli</italic> the same codon (AUA) is a rare codon present at a frequency of only 5.5 per 1000. The other two major differences in codon usage between the <italic>T. acidophilum</italic> A-ATPase A subunit and <italic>E. coli</italic> are AGG (Arg) and AGA (Arg) which are present in <italic>T. acidophilum</italic> A-ATPase A subunit at frequencies of 41 and 16 per 1000 respectively.

When <italic>E. coli</italic> Bl21(DE3), a strain that did not express additional rare tRNAs, was transformed with the cloned <italic>T. acidophilum</italic> ATPase A subunit, no additional protein bands were observed in extracts of induced cells (not shown). However, the <italic>E. coli</italic> Bl21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL strain transformed with the same plasmid expresses two additional proteins of 20 and 65 kDalton upon induction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).

Despite the chemical and physical differences between the <italic>E. coli</italic> cytoplasm and the environment in which the <italic>T. acidophilum</italic> intein is functioning <italic>in vivo,</italic> we found no indications that self-splicing of the intein was inefficient in <italic>E. coli.</italic> Even when <italic>E. coli</italic> was grown at lower temperatures, processing of the intein and religation of the exteins appeared 100% efficient. Complete processing was also observed when the <italic>E. coli</italic> proteins were separated in non-denaturing and non-reducing gels. Autocatalytic splicing of the <italic>T. acidophilum</italic> A-ATPase catalytic subunit occurs efficiently in the <italic>E. coli</italic> cytoplasm.

This indicates that the inteins in <italic>Thermoplasma</italic> and <italic>Pyrococcus</italic> are homologous in the evolutionary sense, <italic>i.e.,</italic> they are derived from a common ancestral gene. However, <italic>Pyrococcus</italic> and <italic>Thermoplasma</italic> are not considered closely related Archaea. Based on their 16S rRNA they are considered distantly related Euryarchaeotes (See Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>).</p><p>One explanation for the discrepancy between phylogenetic classification and distribution of the A-ATPase intein is horizontal gene transfer: the intein was not present in the last common ancestor of <italic>Thermoplasma</italic> and <italic>Pyrococcus,</italic> rather the intein invaded one of the lineages after their split and was more recently horizontally transferred to the other lineage. The horizontal transfer scenario is more parsimonious than the assumption of presence in the shared common ancestor because the latter requires several independently occurring losses of the intein together with its long-term persistence in the <italic>Pyrococcus</italic> and <italic>Thermoplasma</italic> lineages (<italic>cf.</italic> Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>). Horizontal transfer of whole genes and operons between divergent species is a frequent event [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Even house keeping genes are transferred between divergent species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>Two possibilities exist for the horizontal transfer scenario. Either the whole A-ATPase catalytic subunits was transferred, or the intein alone spread as a selfish genetic element. To discriminate between these two scenarios, we constructed the phylogeny of the host protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). The resulting phylogeny is in reasonable agreement with the ribosomal rRNA phylogeny, the main exception being the placement of <italic>Desulfurococcus.</italic> According to its 16S rRNA this organisms is clearly classified as a Crenarcheote; however, its ATPase catalytic subunit groups with <italic>Thermococcus</italic> sp. The finding that the host protein itself does not group the genus <italic>Thermoplasma</italic> with the <italic>Pyrococci</italic> suggests that the intein alone was transferred between <italic>Thermoplasma</italic> and <italic>Pyrococcus,</italic> and that the sequence similarity between the <italic>Thermoplasma</italic> and <italic>Pyrococcus</italic> catalytic subunits was sufficient to allow homing into the same insertion site.</p><p>The dispersion of the intein as a selfish genetic element is consistent with the work of Goddard and Burt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] on the persistence of an intron with homing endonuclease in yeast mitochondria. These authors studied the distribution of empty target sites, and introns with and without a functioning endonuclease gene among different yeasts. They concluded that the long term persistence of the intron depends on a cycle that begins with invasion of the empty target site by an intron with the help of a homing endonuclease encoded by an open reading frame within the intron. However, once the intron containing allele is fixed in the population, the endonuclease, which itself had been the reason for the rapid spread of the intron in the population, is no longer under selection, the endonuclease becomes non-functional and is lost, resulting in an intron without homing endonuclease activity. However, once the endonuclease is lost the intron containing allele becomes more likely to be replaced with an allele that has lost the intron altogether and the cycle of invasion and successive loss begins anew.</p><p>The process of intein homing is likely to depend on a similar cycle; however, the time intervals for loss of the intein are likely to be longer than the loss of the intron. The A-ATPase and the V-ATPase inteins are located in the most conserved part of the host gene. Any deletion of the intein from the gene itself needs to be precise, because any alteration of the amino acid sequence in the catalytic site is likely to result in a non-functioning enzyme. Comparative sequence analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) shows that the <italic>T. acidophilum</italic> and <italic>T. volcanium</italic> inteins do not contain an endonuclease domain. Our search of the genomes of these Archaea did not identify any endonucleases that might function in homing. While the failure to identify a homing endonuclease is not proof of absence, the presence of a homing endonuclease acting in trans would be unprecedented and has to be regarded as improbable. The cyclic reinvasion model for long term persistence of a selfish genetic element through homing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] suggests that the small <italic>Thermoplasma</italic> intein evolved through reduction from a large endonuclease containing intein similar to the one found in the pyrococcal A-ATPase. Apparently, the small intein has been persisting in the <italic>Thermoplasma</italic> A-ATPase since the split between <italic>T. acidophilum</italic> and <italic>T. volcanium</italic> without the help of a homing endonuclease.</p><p>The cyclic reinvasion model also explains why the insertion site is in a region of very low substitution rates: The high degree of sequence similarity surrounding the integration point facilitates the intein transfer between different populations and species using the homing endonuclease. A more variable sequence surrounding the integration point would restrict homing to members of the same species, and would thus lower the chances for long term survival of the intein.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The small intein in the <italic>Thermoplasma</italic> A-ATPase is closely related to the endonuclease containing intein in the <italic>Pyrococcus</italic> A-ATPase. Phylogenies constructed with the host protein (A-ATPase catalytic subunit) and with 16S rRNA do not group these two organisms together, suggesting that the A-ATPase intein spread through horizontal gene transfer. The small intein has persisted in <italic>Thermoplasma</italic> apparently without homing. The <italic>T. acidophilum</italic> intein retains efficient self-splicing activity when expressed in <italic>E. coli.</italic> This activity does not depend on the physicochemical conditions in the <italic>T. acidophilum</italic> cytoplasm.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p><italic>Thermoplasma acidophilum</italic> cultures were obtained from Denis Searcy at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst.

One mL of the broth was used to inoculate 10 mL of LB broth containing ampicillin and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C (200 rpm). After 2 hours, isopropyl thio-&#x003b2;-D-galactoside (IPTG) was added to a final concentration of 1 mM to induce gene expression and the cultures. Cells were harvested 4 hours after induction by centrifugation at 7000 rpm for 10 min and washed with TEP buffer (0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.01 M EDTA and 1 mM phenyl methyl sulfonyl fluoride). Cells were resuspended in 500 &#x003bc;L of TEP buffer and sonicated with a Braun-Sonic U with micro-tip for 4 minutes (0.5 duty cycle; power output approximately 120). The disrupted cells were centrifuged at 8000 rpm and the pellet was resuspended in 500 &#x003bc;L of fresh TEP buffer. Both the supernatant and the pellet were diluted by adding 6X sample buffer (10% SDS, 1.2 mg/mL bromphenol blue, 0.6 M DTT, 30% glycerol, .1 M Tris/HCl pH 6.8) and heated to 80&#x000b0;C for 15 minutes to denature the protein. Five to fifty microliters of this preparation were run in a 10% denaturing Tris/Tricine SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis system as described by Schagger and von Jagow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p><p>Non-denatured protein was prepared with the same procedure except that SDS was omitted from the buffers and that the samples were not heated.

This program calculates and plots the number of substitutions in a sliding window of 10 aligned positions. The window is moved through the alignment one position at a time. For positions where less than 50% of the sequences have a gap, the average number of substitutions was calculated considering the gap as an additional character. Positions with gaps in more than 50% of the aligned sequences were skipped.</p><p>Phylogenies were reconstructed from amino acid sequences aligned using CLUSTAL X 1.8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].

Branch lengths and their confidence intervals were calculated with TREE-PUZZLE 5.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] using the JTT or the HKY model for substitution respectively, and assuming an among site rate variation described by a gamma distribution. Bootstrap samples were analyzed using parsimony as implemented in PAUP* 4.0 beta 8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] treating gaps as missing data. Each bootstrapped sample was analyzed using 10 different starting trees built through random addition, tree-branch-reconnection (TBR) branch swapping, and considering gaps as missing data.
