In spite of considerable work, it is not clear whether divalent cations bind to the enzyme in the absence of nucleotide or only as nucleotide-Me<sup>+2</sup> complex. Here we study the protein ligands for Me<sup>+2</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>When VO<sup>2+</sup> was used as a substitute for Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the ATPase activity of soluble CD39 was 25% of that with Ca<sup>2+</sup> as cofactor. Protein ligands of the VO<sup>2+</sup>-nucleotide complex bound to the catalytic site of soluble CD39 were characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The EPR spectrum contained one species designated T with VO<sup>2+</sup>-AMPPNP as ligand. Two species D1 and D2 were observed when VO<sup>2+</sup>-AMPCP was bound to soluble CD39. The results suggest that species D1 and D2 represent the metal-ADP complexes at the catalytic site of soluble CD39 corresponding to the intermediate formed during ATP hydrolysis and the substrate for further hydrolysis, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>VO<sup>2+</sup> can functionally substitute for Ca<sup>2+</sup> as a cofactor of sCD39, and it produces four different EPR features when bound in the presence of different nucleotides or in the absence of nucleotide. The metal coordination for each conformation corresponding to each EPR species is proposed, and the mechanism of sCD39 catalysis is discussed.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Ecto-Nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases (E-NTPDases, formerly called ecto-ATPases) hydrolyze nucleotides in the presence of divalent cations and are insensitive to inhibitors of P-type, F-type, and V-type ATPases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Three isoforms that differ in the ratio of ATPase/ADPase activity are present on the cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]: E-NTPDase1 with a ratio of 1, E-NTPDase2 with a ratio of 10 and E-NTPDase3 with a ratio of 3&#x02013;5. NTPDases are important in many physiological processes like cell motility, adhesion, nonsynaptic information transfer, secretion, regulation of hemostasis and ectokinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Understanding the enzymatic mechanisms of the NTPDases will help description of their physiological functions, and development of strategies to regulate the functions of the enzymes.</p><p>The catalytic mechanism of NTPDases is not known even though some basic facts of the catalysis have been established. NTPDases do not form phosphorylated intermediates during catalysis, a conclusion also supported by lack of vanadate sensitivity and Pi product inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The catalytic reaction appears to be irreversible and no partial reactions have been observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Divalent cations like Ca<sup>2+</sup> or Mg<sup>2+</sup> are required for activity, and maximal activity is reached when the concentrations of substrates and divalent cations are equal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The specific activities of NTPDases vary over a broad range from ten thousand units for potato apyrase to less than one hundred units for chicken gizzard ecto-ATPase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Sequence comparisons indicate that most of NTPDases contain five highly conserved regions, apyrase conserved region, ACR1 &#x02013; ACR5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. However, the catalytic sites have not been identified, although ACR1 and ACR4 have been implicated in &#x003b2;- and &#x003b3;-phosphate binding, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>E-NTPDase1 is also called CD39, as it was first described as an antigen present on activated B and T lymphocytes. Residues of ACR1 to ACR5 of CD39 have been mutated to study the involvement of the ACR regions in catalysis. E174 in ACR3 and S218 in ACR4 are required for catalytic function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Substitution of H59 in ACR1 converted CD39 into an ADPase in a quaternary structure dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Mutation of W187A in ACR3 affected CD39 folding and translocation, while mutation of W459A in ACR5 increased ATPase activity but diminished ADPase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Mutations of D62 and G64 of ACR1 and D219 and G221 of ACR4 demonstrated that the nucleotide phosphate binding domains of NTPDases are similar to those present in the actin/heat shock protein/sugar kinase superfamily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. These results suggest that the conserved residues of the ACR1 to 5 regions are involved in the catalytic mechanism of CD39.</p><p>The catalytic activity of CD39 is dependent on the presence of divalent cations. Since the interactions of Ca<sup>+2</sup> and Mg<sup>+2</sup> with proteins are difficult to study due to the lack of spectroscopic properties, vanadyl (V<sup>IV</sup>=O)<sup>2+</sup> has been used as a probe of the ligands that compose Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and Mn<sup>2+</sup> binding sites of several proteins, including carboxypeptidase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], S-adenosylmethionine synthetase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], pyruvate kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], and F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. This cation specifically binds to divalent cation binding sites of several enzymes, and in many cases serves as a functional cofactor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Vanadyl has one axial and four equatorial coordination sites relative to the axis of the double-bounded oxygen, an arrangement that is similar to that for Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>. As it is known that the <bold>A</bold> and <bold>g</bold> tensors derived from the EPR spectrum of bound VO<sup>2+</sup> are a direct measure of the nature of the equatorial metal ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], binding of VO<sup>2+</sup> to CD39 could provide details about the catalytic mechanism of CD39.</p><p>Recently we reported that a recombinant soluble CD39, capable of hydrolyzing both ATP and ADP, was expressed and purified from insect cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Only one nucleotide-binding site was identified on the purified soluble CD39 in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> when non-hydrolysable nucleotide analogs were used. In this report, we characterized the signals that were obtained from bound VO<sup>2+</sup> when ATP or ADP was present at the catalytic site of the purified soluble CD39. The possible metal ligands for VO<sup>+2</sup> at the catalytic site are proposed and the catalytic mechanism is discussed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Nucleotidase activity of purified soluble CD39 with VO<sup>2+</sup> as cofactor</title><p>The ability of purified soluble CD39 to hydrolyze VO<sup>2+</sup>ATP is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. Soluble CD39 did not hydrolyze either ATP or ADP in the absence of VO<sup>2+</sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). When VO<sup>2+</sup> was mixed with ATP at a ratio of 1:1, the concentrations of both ADP and AMP increased and ATP decreased as the incubation time was prolonged (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). The ATPase activity of sCD39 with VO<sup>2+</sup> was about 25% of that with Ca<sup>2+</sup> as a cofactor. Vanadyl is unstable in aqueous solution at pH7.0 in the absence of chelator and will precipitate out of solution as [VO(OH)<sub>2</sub>]<sub>n</sub>. The rate of precipitation depends on the abundance and affinity of the chelator. This means that the actual VO<sup>2+</sup> concentration was lower than 0.5 mM. This result indicates that VO<sup>2+</sup> can functionally substitute for Ca<sup>2+</sup> as cofactor for sCD39 nucleotidase activity.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>ATP hydrolysis by sCD39 with VO<sup>2+</sup> as cofactor analyzed by HPLC. 2 &#x003bc;g of sCD39 was included in each assay.

By studying the EPR spectra of bound VO<sup>2+</sup> in the presence of different nucleotides, we show that the interaction of soluble CD39 with ATP is different from that with ADP.</p><p>It is not surprising that VO<sup>2+</sup> can functionally replace Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the hydrolysis of both ATP and ADP by soluble CD39, although the enzymatic activity is about 25% of that with Ca<sup>2+</sup> as the cofactor, since F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase also hydrolyzes ATP at a decreased rate when VO<sup>2+</sup> replaces Mg<sup>2+</sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>The EPR features of VO<sup>2+</sup> are able to reveal some details about how CD39 hydrolyzes ATP and ADP. A single EPR feature, species T, was observed when ADPNP (a non-hydrolyzable analog of ATP) complexed with VO<sup>2+</sup> was bound to sCD39, which is consistent with the presence of only one nucleotide binding site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The g and A tensors derived from species T are 1.9410 and 504.25 MHz respectively, which can be fitted best with one amino group and three groups combined from carboxyl and phosphate groups as the equatorial ligands of the bound VO<sup>2+</sup> on sCD39. In accordance with metal-ATP complex coordination on other enzymes that hydrolyze ATP, like F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], the &#x003b3;- and &#x003b2;-phosphate of ATP most likely bind to VO<sup>2+</sup> while the third carboxyl group is contributed by a side-chain of aspartate or glutamate of sCD39. It is not unusual for the &#x003b5;-amino group of lysine to coordinate with metals in enzymes. It has been reported that the amino group serves as one of VO<sup>2+</sup> equatorial ligands in CF<sub>1</sub>-ATPase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], pyruvate kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], AdoMet synthetase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and carboxypeptidase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Thus one amino group from lysine, one carboxyl group from aspartate or glutamate, and two oxygens from the phosphates of ADPNP serve as the equatorial ligands of sCD39 bound VO<sup>2+</sup> in the presence of ADPNP.</p><p>In the presence of AMPCP, bound VO<sup>2+</sup> produced two EPR features, species D1 and species D2 that are separated by about 30 MHz. As we have reported that sCD39 releases intermediate ADP before ADP is further cleaved during ATP hydrolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], sCD39 probably has two conformations that bind metal-ADP complexes, one is the conformation that releases the ADP intermediate, and another that recruits intermediate ADP back to the enzyme for further hydrolysis to AMP. However, intact CD39 does not release intermediate ADP during ATP hydrolysis, suggesting that there is only one ADP binding site on each CD39 monomer in the intact protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The two EPR species observed with VO<sup>2+</sup>-AMPCP probably correspond to the two different conformations of bound ADP at the same catalytic site on sCD39. The signal intensity of the bound VO<sup>2+</sup>-AMPCP EPR spectrum indicates that species D1 is dominant over species D2. In order to further assign species D1 and D2 to the two different conformations, two experiments were done (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Incubation of sCD39 with VO<sup>2+</sup>-AMPCP at room temperature resulted in a dramatic decrease of the intensity of species D2, while the signal intensity of species D1 remained unchanged. These data indicate that VO<sup>2+</sup>-AMPCP was released from the conformation corresponding to species D2; however, the conformation corresponding to species D1 still had bound VO<sup>2+</sup>-AMPCP. More evidence for two conformations of the enzyme was obtained from the EPR spectra of bound VO<sup>2+</sup>-ATP. No species T was found presumably because ATP was converted to ADP before the sample was frozen. Only species D2 was observed and its intensity decreased as the incubation time was prolonged. We suggest that species D2 corresponds to the conformation that releases ADP as an intermediate product and species D1 corresponds to the conformation that binds ADP as a substrate. The lower signal intensities of species D1 and D2 compared to that of species T suggest that the affinity of sCD39 for ADP or its analog AMPCP is lower than that for the ATP analog ADPNP, which is consistent with the result that only ATP analogs were detected on sCD39 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>The calculated g<sub>||</sub> and A<sub>||</sub> values that best matched the experimental values for species D2 suggest that one hydroxyl group and three oxygens derived from carboxyl groups and phosphates are the equatorial ligands of bound VO<sup>2+</sup>-ADP. Since the conformation corresponding to species D2 is found in the presence of ATP and is likely to be the conformation that releases bound VO<sup>+2</sup>-ADP, it is likely that the VO<sup>+2</sup> ligands are one phosphate and two carboxyl groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. When ADP is the substrate and generates species D1, one water molecule and a combination of three groups between carboxyl groups and phosphates serve as the equatorial ligands of bound VO<sup>2+</sup> on sCD39. The probable combination of carboxyl groups and phosphates for species D1 is one carboxyl group and two phosphates since VO<sup>2+</sup> complexes ADP through two phosphates before VO<sup>2+</sup>-ADP is bound to the enzyme.</p><p>The site directed mutagenesis studies on CD39 and other members of the CD39 family give some hints about the possible residues that serve as metal ligands at the catalytic site of sCD39. The changes of D62 on ACR1, E174 on ACR3, D213 (D219 in HB6) and S218 on ACR4 dramatically decrease both ATPase and ADPase activities of CD39 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> summarizes the possible coordination of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the data of species T, species D1, and species D2 in the different situations of sCD39 catalysis. The catalytic base attack results in cleavage of the &#x003b3;-phosphate of ATP, and one carboxyl group replaces the &#x003b3;-phosphate as a metal ligand (from species T to species D2), which is accompanied by a swap of an amino group with a hydroxyl group (S218?). This hydroxyl group (S218?) probably interacts with the water molecule through hydrogen bond in the conformation corresponding to species D1 to hydrolyze ADP. The constant carboxyl group that appears in all conformations of sCD39 hydrolysis is likely contributed by D213 since it is close to S218.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Summary of the ligands at the metal coordination sites of sCD39 during the catalytic reaction.

Free VO<sup>2+</sup> binds to sCD39 through two hydroxyl groups and two water molecules that are hydrogen bonded to other residues of sCD39. Once free VO<sup>2+</sup> occupies the catalytic site, the enzyme has to either release the metal or correct the conformation before the substrates are recruited properly.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>VO<sup>2+</sup> can functionally substitute for Ca<sup>2+</sup> as a cofactor for sCD39. Four different EPR spectra are obtained for VO<sup>2+</sup> bound in the presence of different nucleotides and in the absence of nucleotide. The protein ligands for VO<sup>+2</sup> in the presence of ATP are suggested to be carboxyl and amino groups, while those in the presence of ADP are probably carboxyl and hydroxyl groups. The mechanism of sCD catalysis is discussed. These results will provide guides for further studies of the catalytic mechanism of NTPDases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>ATP, ADP, ADPNP, AMPCP were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO).
