UCB, in its diacid form (H<sub>2</sub>B), has a low solubility (S<sub>o</sub>) of 51 nM in water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The total solubility (S) at any pH is determined by S<sub>o</sub>, pK<sub><italic>a</italic></sub> values, and pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]:</p><p>S = [H<sub>2</sub>B] + [HB<sup>-</sup>] + [B<sup>=</sup>] = S<sub>o</sub>&#x000b7;(1 + K<sub><italic>a</italic>1</sub>/ [H<sup>+</sup>] + K<sub><italic>a</italic>1</sub>&#x000b7;K<sub><italic>a</italic>2</sub>/ [H<sup>+</sup>]<sup>2</sup>) &#x02003;&#x02003;&#x02003; (<italic>Eq. 1</italic>)</p><p>Self-association of UCB dianion, B<sup>=</sup>, can also increase S [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Beginning in 1995, a series of papers reported the use of <sup>13</sup>C-NMR to study the ionization of a close analogue of bilirubin-IX&#x003b1;, mesobilirubin-XIII&#x003b1; (MBR), along with several soluble reference acids, in buffered mixtures of (C<sup>2</sup>H<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO and water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Due to the very low aqueous solubility of MBR, data were obtained only at two high concentrations of (C<sup>2</sup>H<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO (64 and 27 vol%). Its pK<sub><italic>a</italic></sub> values in "water" (actually in 1 vol% of ((C<sup>2</sup>H<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO), obtained by an extrapolation procedure based on the behavior of soluble reference acids, were 4.2 and 4.9, far lower than values of 8.12 and 8.44 obtained by solvent partition between chloroform and buffered aqueous solutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>These serious discrepancies led us to reexamine several experimental aspects of the <sup>13</sup>C-NMR studies and the implications of their purported low pK<sub><italic>a</italic></sub> values for the solubility of UCB. Inaccuracies in the measurements of buffer pH and of the pK<sub><italic>a</italic></sub> values of the reference <sup>13</sup>C-carboxylic acids, related to failure to correct for the strong effects of DMSO on the pK<sub><italic>a</italic></sub> values of weak acids, have been previously noted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and acknowledged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In addition, as discussed later, a thermodynamic theory about solubility in mixed solvents, using the S<sub>o</sub> values of 51 nM in water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and 10 mM in pure DMSO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], suggested that S<sub>o</sub> of UCB would be only about 0.15 &#x003bc;M in 27 vol% DMSO and 2.2 &#x003bc;M in 64 vol% DMSO, which are well below concentrations used in the MBR studies. This implies serious supersaturation effects. In fact, turbidity was reported for some of the systems used in the <sup>13</sup>C-NMR papers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], indicating the formation of coarse suspensions. By definition, as stressed in the Conclusions section, pK<sub><italic>a</italic></sub> determinations are valid only for monomeric species and require that solutions are below saturation at all pH values studied. Even reversible aggregation of monomers in undersaturated solutions is known to affect pK<sub><italic>a</italic></sub> estimates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. If supersaturation leads to the formation of fine sols or coarse suspensions, the data are unacceptable for determination of the pK<sub><italic>a</italic></sub> values of monomers.</p><p>In the present paper, we assess whether some of the systems used in the <sup>13</sup>C-NMR studies were supersaturated with MBR. Our experimental work on sedimentation was done with unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) and we used DMSO instead of its deuterated analogue, (C<sup>2</sup>H<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO. It is known that, when alkaline aqueous UCB is acidified to neutral or low pH's, "Usually a colloid suspension of bilirubin is formed and the solution remains clear, as observed by the naked eye, thus inviting an erroneous interpretation" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Such systems, which simulate true solutions, often show sedimentation on centrifugation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. We here report that sedimentation of UCB from apparently clear solutions can likewise be extensive when UCB in DMSO is diluted with aqueous buffers to final mole fractions (N) of DMSO = 0.025, 0.086 and 0.31, corresponding to 9, 27, and 64 vol% of DMSO. A thermodynamic theory is used to examine the effect of added DMSO on S<sub>o</sub>. Our findings, consistent with our partition-derived S<sub>o</sub>, S and pK<sub><italic>a</italic></sub> values of UCB in aqueous buffers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], indicate that the recently reported low pK<sub><italic>a</italic></sub> values of MBR in comparable (C<sup>2</sup>H<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO -water systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], were determined above saturation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Residual UCB in the supernatants after centrifugation</title><p>Many systems initially appeared optically clear, but well over 90% of initial UCB sedimented on centrifugation of most samples below pH 7.2.

By contrast, at pH 7.56 and 7.70 (phosphate), only minor precipitation was observed. At N = 0.025 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>); [UCB] ranged from 0.1 to 2.7 &#x003bc;M at all three pH values (4.15 to 7.18).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>A-C.

By contrast, after dilution with 1/8th volume of DMSO to decrease UCB saturation, the supernatants produced no further sedimentation and there were no significant differences in [UCB] or protein concentrations along the axis of the fluid column. Thus, the UCB-HSA complex, which constitutes over 99.9% of the UCB in this system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], did not sediment.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>Findings and their relation to thermodynamic theory</title><p>Supersaturated aqueous systems of UCB, that are optically clear before centrifugation, may exhibit considerable variation in the extent of sedimentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Although sedimentation is often extensive, it is generally incomplete and may not be observed at all. Our data in DMSO-water show the same features, which are expected from the complex kinetics of nucleation and growth of insoluble aggregates of UCB diacid (H<sub>2</sub>B), leading to the formation of a new solid phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Our centrifugation, 5 min at 14,000 <italic>g</italic>, was quite mild, and the short 20-minute period between preparation of UCB-DMSO-water systems and centrifugation severely limited the time-dependent growth to large aggregates. Lack of sedimentation of the UCB-HSA complex (mol. wt. 68,000) indicates that fine colloids composed of 100 UCB molecules would be too small to sediment. Thus, supersaturated systems lacking coarse, insoluble aggregates may not show sedimentation, but any sedimentation observed indicates their presence.</p><p>To evaluate the important effect of pH on sedimentation efficiency, we calculated S in water using chloroform-water partition data on UCB and the best measure of S<sub>o</sub> in chloroform, 0.88 mM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. S at any pH, e.g. 62 nM at pH 7.4 and 0.32 &#x003bc;M at pH 8.5, can be calculated from the fitted partition data, or, equivalently, from Eq. 1, using the partition-derived S<sub>o</sub> in water of 51 nM and pK<sub><italic>a</italic></sub> values of 8.12 and 8.44 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In aqueous systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], the lowest [UCB] in water, below which no sedimentation was observed at 100,000 &#x000d7; <italic>g</italic> for a few hours, was 100 nM at pH 7.4, modestly higher than our partition-derived S of 62 nM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Even under such vigorous centrifugation, the lowest [UCB] increased rapidly with increasing pH, to 17 &#x003bc;M (150 times S) at pH 8.05 and 34 &#x003bc;M (230 times S) at pH 8.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. This indicates increasing charge-stabilization of fine, non-sedimenting colloids of H<sub>2</sub>B by adsorbed UCB anions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In contrast, below pH 6.7, sedimentation of 10 &#x003bc;M UCB was nearly complete [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. This is compatible with a dearth of stabilizing UCB anions at this pH, as expected from the high pK<sub><italic>a</italic></sub> values of 8.12 and 8.44 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Our present data on residual [UCB] in DMSO-water systems likewise show decreased sedimentation with increasing pH (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A,1B,1C</xref>). At each N<sub>DMSO</sub>, the lowest [UCB] were at the lowest pH values: 0.1 &#x003bc;M (N = 0.025, pH 4.15); 0.3 &#x003bc;M (N = 0.086, pH 4.5); and 2.8 &#x00026;#956;M (N = 0.31, pH 5.9). As in water, these are likely to be closest to the S<sub>o</sub> values at each N. Indeed, they are only moderately higher than the corresponding S<sub>o</sub> values of 0.07 &#x003bc;M, 0.15 &#x003bc;M and 2.2 &#x003bc;M, respectively, calculated from Equation 2 using S<sub>o</sub> values of 51 nM in water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and 10 mM in DMSO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>log S<sub>o,mixed</sub> = log S<sub>o,water</sub> + (log S<sub>o,DMSO</sub> - log S<sub>o,water</sub>) &#x000d7; N &#x02003;&#x02003;&#x02003; (<italic>Eq. 2</italic>)</p><p>Equation 2 is a thermodynamic relationship based on assumptions of complete ideality of mixing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In general, a roughly linear variation of log S<sub>o</sub> with N at low N is expected. For example, data from 1-naphthoic acid in DMSO-water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] show that log S<sub>o</sub> is a linear function of N up to N = 0.35. Such a relationship leads to a relatively small effect of low N values on S<sub>o</sub>. Thus, according to Equation 2, S<sub>o</sub> increases by a factor of only 1.4 at N = 0.025 and 2.9 at N = 0.086, but by a relatively larger factor of 44 at N = 0.31. This would markedly reduce the supersaturation factor ([UCB]/ S<sub>o</sub>), which is a measure of the tendency of UCB to come out of solution at N = 0.31. This explains in part the relatively high [UCB] at high pH at N = 0.31 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).</p><p>The pH effects on [UCB] at each N<sub>DMSO</sub> are of interest also. The lowest [UCB] at each pH registered relatively small increases with significant increases in pH: for example from 0.1 &#x003bc;M (pH 4.14) to 0.2 &#x003bc;M (pH 7.0) at N = 0.025; from 0.3 &#x003bc;M (pH 4.5) to 1.4 &#x003bc;M (pH 7.1) at N = 0.086; and from 111 &#x003bc;M (pH 7.1) to 166 &#x003bc;M (pH 8.4) at N = 0.31. These increases are probably caused mainly by increasing charge-stabilization of colloidal aggregates, as in aqueous media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. If, instead, the relatively small increases are ascribed entirely to increases in true solubility (S) at the high pH (Eq. 1), the required pK<sub><italic>a</italic></sub> values are about 7 at N = 0.025 and 0.086, and 8.5 at N = 0.31. The true pK<sub><italic>a</italic></sub>s of UCB in DMSO-water are thus probably significantly higher.</p><p>We note that some variability in sedimentation results from our short-term experiments, most evident at the low residual [UCB] in Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, in part magnified by the log-log scale used. Some variability is expected, however, because of the complexity of the kinetic processes of nucleation, growth and flocculation that precede sedimentation. In Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, the difference between acetate and Tris buffers is quite small (note the linear scale), compatible with the 58% higher [H<sup>+</sup>] in the acetate buffer. In Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, the markedly lower sedimentation from phosphate buffers at pH 7.6&#x02013;7.7, as compared to Tris buffer at pH 7.1, can be ascribed mainly to the much higher pH values and ionic strength of the phosphate systems. Another significant factor may be the difference in charge between the buffer salts; phosphate is anionic whereas Tris is cationic and zwitterionic. The cationic species of Tris can, in principle, reduce the negative charges on the surface of the colloidal H<sub>2</sub>B sufficiently to facilitate the formation of coarser particles and, thus, increase sedimentation.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications for pK<sub><italic>a</italic></sub> values of mesobilirubin-XIII&#x003b1; (MBR)</title><p>In the recent <sup>13</sup>C-NMR studies of the ionization of the <sup>13</sup>C-COOH groups of MBR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], it was assumed that the relevant physical properties of UCB and MBR, and of (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO (DMSO) and (C<sup>2</sup>H<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO, are similar. Actually, as expected from the replacement of two vinyl groups in UCB with two ethyl groups in MBR, MBR is slightly more soluble in organic solvents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and has a higher R<sub>f</sub> on silica gel t.l.c. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]; MBR is thus more hydrophobic and should be less soluble in water than is UCB. Our low [UCB] in DMSO-water systems at comparable N, therefore, indicate that many of the (C<sup>2</sup>H<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO/buffer systems used in the <sup>13</sup>C-NMR studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] were likely supersaturated with MBR. In those studies, the MBR concentrations used were stated to be 1 to 100 &#x003bc;M at N = 0.086 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], compared to our lowest [UCB] of 0.3 &#x003bc;M at pH 4.5 and 1.4 &#x003bc;M at pH 7.05. At this N, 9 of 11 MBR data points were obtained at pH below 7.05 and 5 below pH 4.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], so that even 1 &#x003bc;M MBR was likely to be supersaturated. At N = 0.31, our lowest [UCB], 2.8 &#x003bc;M at pH 5.9, was close to the lower limit of the 2 to 800 &#x003bc;M range of [MBR] used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Thus, many data points, obtained at pH values down to 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], were probably from supersaturated systems, despite being optically clear. As noted here and elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], optical clarity gives no assurance of the absence of supersaturation.</p><p>Actually, turbidity was reported in some of the <sup>13</sup>C-NMR samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], indicating that coarse, insoluble aggregates of MBR were present. The claim that such turbidity did not affect <sup>13</sup>C-NMR measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] contrasts with evidence that even small multimers can change NMR chemical shifts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. It should be noted also that, at high concentrations of B<sup>=</sup>, extensive, reversible self-association of B<sup>=</sup> can lead to apparently stable supersaturation with no separation of an insoluble phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. For example, at pH 8.5 and a UCB concentration of 20 &#x003bc;M (63 times S), the weight-average aggregation number of UCB has been found to be 7.17 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], corresponding to a molecular weight of 4,195. The aggregation number remained fairly high, 4.2, in 60% (w/v) ethanol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The successful application of equilibrium ultracentrifugation for that study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] suggests a complete absence of even small colloidal species of UCB. Self-association of MBR dianions in (C<sup>2</sup>H<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO-water mixtures cannot be ruled out on <italic>a priori</italic> grounds. It has been shown that neglect of self-association of B<sup>=</sup> leads to an artefactually low estimate of pK<sub><italic>a</italic></sub> values for UCB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>In addition to the problems of insolubility, supersaturation and self-aggregation of the MBR systems in (C<sup>2</sup>H<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO-water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], we had shown previously that inaccuracies in the pH measurements affected both the magnitude of &#x00394;pK<sub><italic>a</italic></sub> (the change in pK<sub><italic>a</italic></sub> on adding (C<sup>2</sup>H<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO to water), as well as the degree of the variation of &#x00394;pK<sub><italic>a</italic></sub> with N [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. This is important for extrapolating pK<sub><italic>a</italic></sub> values in (C<sup>2</sup>H<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO-water to pure water (N = 0). Indeed, remeasurement of one soluble acid raised its pK<sub><italic>a</italic></sub> by as much as 3 units at N = 0.31 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Thus, the inaccuracies in pH measurement produced serious errors in reported pK<sub><italic>a</italic></sub> values of more than fifteen soluble acids used as models for MBR, as well as for MBR itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Many methods, using appropriate pH measurements, have been applied in the past to determine thermodynamic pK<sub><italic>a</italic></sub> values of soluble acids in non-aqueous or partially aqueous media, including DMSO-water systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Many other relevant references were given in our prior paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In that paper, our pK<sub><italic>a</italic></sub> measurements on acetic acid in DMSO-water systems were based on the potentiometric method, using properly calibrated glass electrodes, which determine the activity of H<sup>+</sup>, and on estimates of the activity coefficients of the acetate ion. This method, which is well established for aqueous solutions, yielded results in good agreement with data from the literature that was based on a very different method, measurements of electrical conductivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In the <sup>13</sup>C-NMR papers, therefore, it was not justified, to assume that pH values do not change on adding DMSO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], or to use uncalibrated pH measurements for determination of the pK<sub><italic>a</italic></sub> values of soluble acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Our sedimentation data and their interpretation indicate that significant additional uncertainties, not important for the soluble acids investigated, exist for the reported pK<sub><italic>a</italic></sub> values of the relatively insoluble MBR in (CD<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO-water (4.2 and 4.9 at N = 0.086 and 4.3 and 5.0 at N = 0.31), as well as their extrapolation to obtain pK<sub><italic>a</italic></sub> values of 4.2 and 4.9 in water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Indeed, if these low aqueous pK<sub><italic>a</italic></sub> values, along with the experimental S values at pH 8.5 of 0.32 &#x003bc;M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], or 0.6 &#x003bc;M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], are applied to Eq. 1, the calculated extremely low S<sub>o</sub> values of UCB diacid of 4 or 8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-15</sup> M are seven orders of magnitude lower than the experimental S<sub>o</sub>, 5.1 &#x000d7; 10&#x02013;8 M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Applying the S<sub>o</sub> of 4 or 8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-15</sup> M to Eq. 2, moreover, would indicate massive supersaturation (up to 8 to 10 orders of magnitude) of MBR at the concentrations (1&#x02013;800 &#x003bc;M) used in the 13C-NMR studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The present sedimentation data for UCB in DMSO-water demonstrate that the true solubilities of UCB, even at fairly high pH values, are low at DMSO mole fractions up to 0.31. The results and related considerations are compatible with similar results in purely aqueous solutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and support both the estimated solubility (S<sub>o</sub>) of 5.1 &#x000d7; 10&#x02013;8 M for uncharged UCB (H<sub>2</sub>B) in water, and the corresponding high aqueous pK<sub><italic>a</italic></sub> values of 8.12 and 8.44, derived from our partition studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. These were performed in undersaturated systems and took into account the self-association of B<sup>=</sup>. Our experimental data indicate problems of insolubility, supersaturation and self-aggregation of UCB in DMSO-water mixtures with compositions similar to the MBR systems in (C<sup>2</sup>H<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO -water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In (C<sup>2</sup>H<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO-water, DMSO-water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] or any other medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], properly determined pK<sub><italic>a</italic></sub> values for the dissociation equilibria of a diacid H<sub>2</sub>A (H<sub>2</sub>A &#x0003c;--&#x0003e; HA<sup>-</sup> + H<sup>+</sup> and HA<sup>-</sup> &#x0003c;--&#x0003e; A<sup>=</sup> + H<sup>+</sup>) must pertain to monomeric H<sub>2</sub>A, HA<sup>-</sup> and A<sup>=</sup>, the solute species involved in the stated equilibria, and require unambiguous determination of [H<sup>+</sup>] or pH. Unless pK<sub><italic>a</italic></sub> values are determined for monomeric systems, relative concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>A, HA<sup>-</sup> and A<sup>=</sup> cannot be determined from the pK<sub><italic>a</italic></sub> values and the pH. The <sup>13</sup>C-NMR data, suggesting low pK<sub><italic>a</italic></sub> values for MBR in (C<sup>2</sup>H<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO -water and water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], did not meet these essential requirements of proper pH measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] nor provide assurance that the MBR in every system was below saturation and not self-associated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The issues raised are not trivial, since the pK<sub><italic>a</italic></sub> and S<sub>o</sub> values of UCB are clinically relevant to the effects of pH on the precipitation of calcium bilirubinates in pigment gallstones and the neurotoxicity caused by UCB diacid in severely jaundiced neonates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>UCB (Calbiochem) was purified by alkaline extraction of a chloroform solution, recrystallized twice from chloroform-methanol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], dried under Argon, stored in<italic>vacuo</italic> in the dark and used within 6 weeks.

Water used was deionized and distilled. All flasks and tubes were Kimax glass, washed with 0.1 N HCl and rinsed 4X with water and then dried before use. Stock buffers, 1.0 M, were: Tris-HCl, pH 7.01; Na- phosphate, pH 6.85, or 6.99; and Na-acetate, pH 4.01. Stock UCB in DMSO (4 to 6 mM) and stock HSA, 613 &#x003bc;M in 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.01, were prepared freshly for each experiment.</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of UCB-DMSO-buffer systems</title><p>Test systems (4.0 mL) of UCB were prepared in duplicate: to 0.4 mL of the stock buffer were added successively the appropriate volumes of water, DMSO and, finally, up to 150 &#x003bc;L of stock UCB/DMSO solution.

Absorbance (<italic>A</italic>) was measured in triplicate at 458 nm on each sample, diluted, when necessary, with DMSO or DMSO/buffer mixture to <italic>A</italic> of 0.2 to 0.8; a comparable medium without UCB was used as a blank.

Microcentrifugation for 5 min yielded a small amount of precipitated UCB. Three aliquots of the clear supernatant were diluted with 1/8th volume of DMSO and a fourth aliquot diluted with 1/8th volume of buffer. The diluted samples (in duplicate) were then microcentrifuged for another 10 min and 25 &#x003bc;L samples taken from the top, middle and bottom of the fluid column in each tube, using a Hamilton syringe.
