We previously reported that cardiac cardiolipin levels, MLCL AT and cardiolipin synthase activities were all elevated in rats made hyperthyroid by thyroxine treatment. In this study, we examined if cardiac mitochondrial MLCL AT activity was dependent upon the biosynthesis and level of cardiolipin in the heart. Rat heart mitochondrial MLCL AT activity was determined under conditions in which the levels of cardiac cardiolipin and cardiolipin synthase activity were either reduced or unaltered using four different disease models in the rat. In addition, these parameters were examined in a murine model of cardiac cell differentiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In rats made hypothyroid by treatment with 6-n-propyl-2-thiouracil in the drinking water for 34 days, cardiac cardiolipin content was decreased 29% (p &#x0003c; 0.025) and this was associated with a 32% decrease (p &#x0003c; 0.025) in cardiolipin synthase and a 35% reduction (p &#x0003c; 0.025) in MLCL AT activities. Streptozotocin-induced diabetes or hyperinsulinemia in rats did not affect cardiac cardiolipin content nor MLCL AT and cardiolipin synthase activities. Finally, cardiolipin content, MLCL AT and cardiolipin synthase activities were unaltered during murine P19 teratocarcinoma cell differentiation into cardiac myocytes. In all models, phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> activities were unaltered compared with controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We propose a general model in which the expression of MLCL AT activity is regulated in concert with the biosynthesis and level of cardiolipin in the heart.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Phospholipids are important structural and functional components of the biological membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Structurally, as major components of the biological membrane, they define compartmentalization of organelles and the protective barrier, the cell membrane, which surrounds cells. An important class of phospholipids are the polyglycerophospholipids. Cardiolipin (CL), the first polyglycerophospholipid discovered, was isolated from beef heart by Pangborn in 1942 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In the heart, CL represents approximately 12&#x02013;16% of the entire cardiac phospholipid mass and is found exclusively in mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>In mammalian tissues CL is required for the reconstituted activity of a number of key mitochondrial enzymes involved in cellular energy metabolism including for example cytochrome c oxidase, carnitine palmitoyltransferase, creatine phosphokinase, pyruvate translocator, mono-, di- and tricarboxylate carriers, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphate transporter, ATP/ADP translocase and ATP synthase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Under experimental conditions in which CL was removed or digested away from these proteins with phospholipases, denaturation and complete loss in activity of many of these proteins was observed. CL interaction with these proteins was specific since substitution with other phospholipids did not fully reconstitute activity. The fatty acyl composition of CL also appeared to be important for this functional reconstitution. For example, the activity of delipidated rat liver cytochrome c oxidase was reconstituted by the addition of CL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The specific activity of reconstituted cytochrome c oxidase varied significantly with different fatty acyl compositions of CL. A strong positive correlation has been established between fatty acid unsaturation of CL and antioxidant production in cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In staurosporine-treated granulosa cells undergoing apoptosis CL levels were reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Peroxidation of CL induced release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol and this was associated with the induction of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Suppression of CL peroxidation inhibited release of cytochrome c from mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Thus, the activities of the enzymes that synthesize and remodel CL play a pivotal role in maintaining the content and molecular composition of CL and hence may regulate a plethora of cellular processes from energy metabolism to apoptosis.</p><p>In mammalian tissues CL is synthesized by condensation of phosphatidylglycerol with cytidine-5'-diphosphate-1,2-diacyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycerol catalyzed by CL synthase [for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]]. Thyroxine treatment of rats stimulated the expression of rat liver and heart mitochondrial CL synthase activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The increase in CL synthase activity accounted for the elevated levels of CL observed in these organs. We recently identified and characterized the activity of monolysocardiolipin acyltransferase (MLCL AT), the enzyme responsible for monolysocardiolipin (MLCL) acylation to CL in mammalian tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In another study, we showed that thyroxine treatment of rats elevated cardiac MLCL AT activity and postulated that MLCL AT may be a rate-limiting enzyme for the molecular remodeling of CL in the heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The above studies prompted us to examine if cardiac MLCL AT activity was linked to CL biosynthesis and content in the heart. Our results, using four different disease models in the rat in which the level of cardiac CL is either reduced, elevated or unaltered, demonstrate that this is the case. We also observe this relationship in a model of murine cardiac cell differentiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Cardiac CL content, CL synthase and MLCL AT activities are reduced in hypothyroid rats</title><p>In previous studies we observed that cardiac MLCL AT activity was elevated when the cardiac CL content and CL synthase activity were elevated in hyperthyroid rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. We examined if cardiac CL content, CL synthase and MLCL AT activities were reduced in hypothyroid rats. Rats were made hypothyroid by the addition of 0.05% PTU to their drinking water for 34 days. This protocol was shown to produce decreased serum thyroid hormone levels and result in cardiac atrophy in the rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. As seen in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, in rats that received PTU there was a 48% decrease (p &#x0003c; 0.025) in heart weight compared to controls. In addition, the heart to body weight ratio decreased, indicative of cardiac atrophy. Growth failure was demonstrated by the decreased body weights of the hypothyroid animals compared to controls. As a further control, the activity of an inner mitochondrial membrane marker, succinate dehydrogenase, was determined. Cardiac mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase activity was reduced 23% (p &#x0003c; 0.025) from 30 &#x000b1; 3 &#x003bc;mol/min&#x000b7;mg to 23 &#x000b1; 3 &#x003bc;mol/min&#x000b7;mg protein in PTU-treated rats. These are documented characteristics of hypothyroidism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Body weight, heart weight, heart CL content, CL synthase and MLCL AT activities in normal and hypothyroid rats.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td></td><td align="center">Control</td><td align="center">Hypothyroid</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Heart weight (g)</td><td align="center">1.23 &#x000b1; 0.03</td><td align="center">0.64 &#x000b1; 0.04<sup>*</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Body weight (g)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;Before PTU treatment</td><td align="center">206 &#x000b1; 4</td><td align="center">205 &#x000b1; 4</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;After PTU treatment</td><td align="center">441 &#x000b1; 19</td><td align="center">275 &#x000b1; 20<sup>*</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Heart weight:body weight (&#x000d7;100)</td><td align="center">0.28 &#x000b1; 0.02</td><td align="center">0.23 &#x000b1; 0.03<sup>*</sup></td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="center" colspan="2">nmol/mg heart</td></tr><tr><td align="left">CL content</td><td align="center">6.1 &#x000b1; 0.1</td><td align="center">4.3 &#x000b1; 0.4<sup>*</sup></td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="center" colspan="2">pmol/min&#x000b7;mg protein</td></tr><tr><td align="left">CL synthase activity</td><td align="center">3.1 &#x000b1; 0.3</td><td align="center">2.1 &#x000b1; 0.2<sup>*</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left">MLCL AT activity</td><td align="center">40 &#x000b1; 6</td><td align="center">26 &#x000b1; 3<sup>*</sup></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><bold>Rats were made hypothyroid by administration of 0.05% PTU in the drinking water for 34 days.</bold> The hearts were harvested, weighed and CL content, CL synthase and MLCL AT activities determined.

We initially determined the activity of cardiac mitochondrial PA:CTP cytidylyltransferase, a rate-limiting enzyme of CL biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. PA:CTP cytidylyltransferase activity was 15.1 &#x000b1; 1.2 pmol/min/mg protein and unaltered (14.7 &#x000b1; 1.1 pmol/min/mg protein) in cardiac mitochondrial fractions prepared from hypothyroid rats. Hence, PA:CTP cytidylyltransferase served as a control for a mitochondrial enzyme not affected by hypothyroidism. When compared to controls, heart mitochondria prepared from hypothyroid rats exhibited a 29% decrease (p &#x0003c; 0.025) in CL content, a 32% decrease (p &#x0003c; 0.025) in CL synthase activity and a 35% decrease (p &#x0003c; 0.025) in MLCL AT activity (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). PLA<sub>2</sub> activity was 4.2 &#x000b1; 0.7 nmol/min&#x000b7;mg protein and unaltered (4.0 &#x000b1; 0.5 nmol/min&#x000b7;mg protein) in cardiac mitochondria prepared from hypothyroid rats. Thus, cardiac mitochondrial CL content, CL synthase and MLCL AT activities were all reduced in hypothyroid rats.</p></sec><sec><title>Cardiac CL content, CL synthase and MLCL AT activities are unaltered in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats and in hyperinsulinemic rats</title><p>Previously we showed that cardiac phosphatidylglycerol levels were reduced in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats but CL synthase activity and CL content were unaltered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. We examined if streptozotocin-induced diabetes in rats altered MLCL AT activity or if hyperinsulinemia in rats altered CL synthase and MLCL AT activities in cardiac mitochondria. Rats were made diabetic by injection of steptozotocin or hyperinsulinemic by intraperitoneal addition of insulin. Subsequently, the hearts were removed and mitochondrial fractions prepared. Cardiac CL synthase activities were 3.0 &#x000b1; 0.5 pmol/min&#x000b7;mg protein in hyperinsulinemic rats and did not differ from control (3.1 &#x000b1; 0.6 pmol/min&#x000b7;mg protein) non-insulin injected animals. Cardiac CL content was 5.9 &#x000b1; 0.5 nmol/mg heart and unaltered compared to controls (6.1 &#x000b1; 0.1 nmol/mg heart). Cardiac MLCL AT activities were 38 &#x000b1; 6 pmol/min&#x000b7;mg protein in diabetic rats and 43 &#x000b1; 9 pmol/min&#x000b7;mg protein in hyperinsulinemic rats and did not differ from controls (40 &#x000b1; 6 pmol/min&#x000b7;mg protein saline injected and 41 &#x000b1; 9 pmol/min&#x000b7;mg protein non-insulin injected animals, respectively). Thus, in streptozotocin-induced diabetes and hyperinsulinemia, conditions in which the CL content and CL synthase activities were unaltered, MLCL AT activity was unaltered.</p></sec><sec><title>CL content, CL synthase and MLCL AT activities are unaltered during cardiac cell differentiation</title><p>As a distinct model, we examined if CL synthase activity was altered in murine P19 teratocarcinoma cells induced to undergo differentiation into cardiac myocytes. We chose this model since differentiation of murine P19 cells into cardiac myocytes results in an increase in phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis, phosphatidylethanolamine mass and lysophosphatidylethanolamine acyltransferase activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The cells were harvested at various times, 0&#x02013;8 days post DMSO addition, and MRNA analysis of markers of cardiac cell differentiation performed on cell lysates. GATA-4 is a member of the GATA family of zinc finger transcription factors and is an early marker of cardiac cell differentiation. As seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, GATA-4 was expressed at 4 days post DMSO addition relative to the constitutive expression of tubulin. As expected GATA-4 expression preceded the expression of other cardiac genes including B-natriuretic peptide (BNP), alpha myosin heavy chain (&#x003b1;MHC), beta myosin heavy chain (&#x003b2;MHC) and Troponin C relative to the constitutive expression of tubulin. Thus, the P19 cells used in this study differentiated into cardiac myocytes. As previously shown CL content, MLCL AT and PLA<sub>2</sub> activities were unaltered during P19 cell differentiation into cardiac myocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. CL synthase activity was 2.7 &#x000b1; 0.5 pmol/min&#x000b7;mg protein in undifferentiated and unaltered (2.8 &#x000b1; 0.3 pmol/min&#x000b7;mg protein) in differentiated P19 cells. Together, the above five models using hyper- and hypothyroid, diabetic and hyperinsulinemic rats and murine P19 cell differentiation into cardiac myocytes all indicate that expression of mammalian cardiac mitochondrial MLCL AT activity appears to be regulated in concert with the biosynthesis and content of CL in the heart.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of genes during differentiation of P19 cells into cardiac myocytes.</bold> P19 cells were incubated with 1% DMSO for up to 8 days.

For example, reduction in the content of CL was shown to reduce oxygen consumption in mitochondria prepared from rat liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Thus, maintenance of the appropriate content of CL in mammalian mitochondria is essential for proper mitochondrial function. Thyroxine treatment of rats was shown to stimulate the activity of rat liver mitochondrial CL synthase 2.5-fold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. This elevation in rat liver mitochondrial CL synthase activity was suggested to account for the elevated levels of CL observed in livers prepared from hyperthyroid rats. In addition, CL synthase was shown to be elevated in heart mitochondria prepared from hyperthyroid rats and this was correlated with an increase in cardiac CL content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Prior to the current study, CL synthase activity had not been determined in any model of hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism in the rat resulted in a 25% reduction in cardiac CL synthase activity. This reduction in CL synthase activity likely accounted for the reduced levels of cardiac CL observed in hearts prepared from hypothyroid animals. Previous studies in the rat have indicated that hypothyroidism also results in reduced CL levels in the liver [for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]]. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that CL synthase activity would also be reduced in the liver of hypothyroid animals. In the current study, CL synthase activity was unaltered in diabetic and hyperinsulinemic rats and in a model of murine cardiac cell differentiation. In these models, the content of CL was unaltered. These data suggest that the level of CL produced in the mammalian heart is regulated in concert with the level of CL synthase activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Previous and current studies in the heart support the hypothesis that cardiac MLCL AT activity may be regulated in concert with CL content and CL synthase activity</title><p>The data presented in this paper are entirely consistent with the conclusion that the expression of MLCL AT activity in the heart is regulated in concert with the biosynthesis and content of cardiac CL. Previously, we demonstrated that thyroxine-treatment of rats resulted in an increase in cardiac CL content, CL synthase and MLCL AT activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In the present study rats made hypothyroid with PTU in the drinking water had reduced cardiac CL content, CL synthase and MLCL AT activities. In contrast, in streptozotocin-induced diabetes and hyperinsulinemia, pathological conditions in which cardiac mitochondial CL content and CL synthase were unaltered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], MLCL AT activities were unaltered. In addition, CL content, CL synthase and MLCL AT activities were unaltered during cardiac cell differentiation. It is reasonable to propose that when the rate of synthesis and level of CL is either reduced or elevated expression of the activities of the enzymes that remodel CL should be correspondingly reduced or elevated. The activity of cardiac mitochondrial PLA<sub>2</sub> was high (100-fold) relative to cardiac mitochondrial MLCL AT activity and was unaltered in all models examined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Since MLCL AT activity was either increased or decreased under conditions in which elevated or reduced CL remodelling was required, i.e. elevated or reduced CL synthesis, it is possible that MLCL AT may be rate-limiting for MLCL acylation to CL in the mammalian heart. However, it should be considered that other factors such as the intra-mitochondrial level of MLCL may be limiting for the acylation of MLCL to CL.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>A summary of our findings is presented in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>. In hyperthyroidism, when cardiac CL synthase activity and CL content are elevated an increase in MLCL AT activity is observed. In hypothyroidism, when cardiac CL synthase activity and CL content are reduced a decrease in MLCL AT activity is observed. Finally, when cardiac CL synthase activity and CL content are unaltered in streptozotocin-induced diabetes, hyperinsulinemia and murine P19 cell differentiation into cardiac myocytes, MLCL AT activity is unaltered. Thus, expression of MLCL AT activity is regulated in concert with the biosynthesis and content of cardiac CL.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Summary of mammalian cardiac mitochondrial MLCL AT activities, CL synthase activities and CL content in various cardiac models.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td></td><td align="left">CL content</td><td align="left">CL Synthase Activity</td><td align="left">MLCL AT Activity</td><td align="left">References</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Hyperthyroidism</td><td align="left">increased</td><td align="left">increased</td><td align="left">increased</td><td align="left">[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Hypothyroidism</td><td align="left">decreased</td><td align="left">decreased</td><td align="left">decreased</td><td align="left">[this paper]</td></tr><tr><td align="left">STZ-induced diabetes</td><td align="left">unaltered</td><td align="left">unaltered</td><td align="left">unaltered</td><td align="left">[[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], this paper]</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Hyperinsulinemia</td><td align="left">unaltered</td><td align="left">unaltered</td><td align="left">unaltered</td><td align="left">[this paper]</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Murine P19 cell differentiation into cardiac myocytes</td><td align="left">unaltered</td><td align="left">unaltered</td><td align="left">unaltered</td><td align="left">[[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], this paper]</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Male Sprague Dawley rats (125&#x02013;175 g) were used throughout the study and were housed in a temperature and light controlled room.

Phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> (PLA<sub>2</sub>) was determined as described using phosphatidyl [<sup>14</sup>C]glycerol as substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. CL synthase and phosphatidic acid (PA):CTP cytidylyltransferase activities were determined as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. MLCL AT activities were determined as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Mitochondrial fractions (50 &#x003bc;g) were incubated for 30 min at 25&#x000b0;C in 50 mM Tris-HCL, pH 8.0, 33 &#x003bc;M [1-<sup>14</sup>C]linoleoyl-Coenzyme A (68,700 dpm/nmol), 0.3 mM MLCL in a final volume of 0.35 ml. The reaction was initiated by the addition of [1-<sup>14</sup>C]linoleoyl-Coenzyme A substrate and terminated by addition of 3 ml of chloroform:methanol (2:1, by vol). 0.8 ml of KCL was added to facilitate phase separation. The aqueous phase was removed and the organic phase dried under nitrogen and resuspended in 25 &#x003bc;l of chloroform:methanol (2:1, by vol). A 20 &#x003bc;l aliquot was placed on a thin layer plate and CL was separated from other phospholipids in a solvent system containing chloroform:hexane:methanol:acetic acid (50:30:10:5, by vol). The silica gel corresponding to CL was removed and placed in plastic scintillation vials with 5 ml of aqueous counting scintillant. Radioactivity incorporated into CL was determined approximately 24 h later using a liquid scintillation counter. CL content was determined as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase activity was determined as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Students t-test was used for the determination of statistical significance. The level of significance was defined as p &#x0003c; 0.025.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>CL, Cardiolipin; MLCL AT, monolysocardiolipin acyltransferase; MLCL, monolysocardiolipin; PTU, 6-n-propyl-2-thiouracil; PLA<sub>2</sub>, phospholipase A<sub>2</sub>; PA, phosphatidic acid; DMSO, dimethylsulfoxide; CTP, cytidine-5'-triphosphate; ATP, adenosine-5'-triphosphate; ADP, adenosine-5'-diphosphate; BNP, B-natriuretic peptide; &#x003b1;MHC, alpha myosin heavy chain; &#x003b2;MHC, beta myosin heavy chain; mRNA, messenger ribonucleic acid; STZ, Stre ptozotocin</p></sec><sec><title>Authors contribution</title><p>Mr. William A.
