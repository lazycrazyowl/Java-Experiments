An important goal is to understand the mechanism of how the misfolded proteins are recognized, retained, and targeted for degradation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Using a web-based algorithm, PESTFind, we found a PEST sequence in the regulatory (R) domain of CFTR. The PEST sequence is found in many short-lived eukaryotic proteins and plays a role in their degradation. To determine its role in the stability and degradation of misprocessed CFTR, we introduced a number of site-directed mutations into the PEST sequence in the cDNA of &#x00394;F508 CFTR, the most prevalent misprocessed mutation found in CF patients. Analysis of these mutants showed that the disruption of the PEST sequence plays a minor role in the degradation of the CFTR mutants. Multiple mutations to the PEST sequence within the R domain of CFTR inhibit maturation of CFTR and prevent the formation of a 100 kDa degradation product. The mutations, however, do not improve the stability of the mutant &#x00394;F508 CFTR.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These observations show that disruption of the structure of the R domain of CFTR can inhibit maturation of the protein and that the predicted PEST sequence plays no significant role in the degradation of CFTR.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene cause cystic fibrosis (CF), the most prevalent fatal recessive genetic disease in the Caucasian population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. CFTR is a polytopic integral membrane protein synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and normally expressed on the apical surface of epithelial cells where it functions as a phosphorylation-stimulated and ATP-dependent chloride channel. The majority of CF patients express processing defective CFTRs that fail to mature to the cell surface; instead, the processing defective CFTRs are retained in the ER and are targeted for rapid degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>The retention of processing defective CFTR is a response of the ER quality control system to misfolded proteins, which prevents the progression of misfolded or misassembled membrane and secretory proteins into later compartments of the secretory pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. During synthesis, nascent CFTR polypeptide chains are translated from ER membrane-bound ribosomes and are inserted into the ER membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Various classes of chaperones associate with the nascent polypeptide both in the lumen of the ER and in the cytosol to aid in folding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Upon proper folding, the properly folded CFTR dissociate from the chaperones and are packaged into transport vesicles for export to a post-ER compartment in the secretory pathway, the Golgi. Many of the missense mutations in CFTR retard the folding process. This leads to prolonged association of the nascent chains with the molecular chaperones and prevents the nascent chains from exiting the ER through the default secretory pathway. Instead, the misfolded polypeptides are retrotranslocated across the ER membrane, into the cytosol, and targeted for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Although much of the molecular mechanism of the ubiquitin-proteasome system has now been elucidated (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]), the precise mechanism and determinants of recognition of the misfolded polypeptides remain unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. As proposed by Chang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], the retention of misfolded CFTR is most likely due to the exposure of short sequence motifs specifically recognized by components of the ER quality control system or vesicular transport system; the mutations may cause localized misfolding leading to global misfolding to expose or bury motifs that signal for degradation, retention or exportation from the ER. Indeed, it has been shown that the removal of multiple arginine-framed ER retention/retrieval trafficking signals overcomes misprocessing of &#x00394;F508 CFTR, the most prevalent processing defective CF mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, attempts to promote maturation of the processing defective mutants by shutting down the cytosolic proteasomes via proteasome inhibitors have led to the speculation of the existence of other systems responsible for the retention and degradation of these processing defective CFTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Treatment of cells expressing wild-type (WT) CFTR with MG-132, an inhibitor of the 26S proteasome in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, leads to inhibition of maturation of the CFTR polypeptide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The resulting maturation-hindered WT CFTR polypeptide exhibit similar stability, structural, and functional properties to misprocessed CFTR mutants such as the prevalent &#x00394;F508 CFTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>PEST sequences are found in many rapidly degraded proteins. These sequences have been suggested to serve as signals for proteolytic degradation. From a survey of the amino acid sequences of 10 short-lived eukaryotic proteins, Rogers et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] found the proteins to contain one or more regions rich in proline (P), glutamic acid (E), serine (S), and threonine (T). These regions are often flanked by positively charged amino acids. They named these regions PEST regions. Based on their observation, they developed an algorithm that would search for such regions in a given protein sequence.</p><p>In the present study, we examine the role of a PEST sequence, found in CFTR, in the stability and degradation of CFTR.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>PEST sequence of CFTR</title><p>The algorithm, PESTFind, searches for hydrophilic regions of 12 or greater amino acids that contain at least one P (proline), one E (glutamic acid) or D (aspartic acid), and one S (serine) or T (threonine), flanked by K (lysine), R (arginine), or H (histidine) residues. The algorithm assigns a score to each possible PEST sequence found. The score ranges from -50 to +50, with a score above zero denoting a possible PEST region while a value greater than + 5 being of particular interest. Using the algorithm, PESTFind <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.at.embnet.org/embnet/tools/bio/PESTfind/"/>, we found a highly conserved PEST region in the regulatory domain of the CFTR protein (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The CFTR PEST region (residues 716 &#x02013; 734) scored + 6.91 and had a hydrophobicity index of 32.63. Within the 19 residues PEST region, 8 are charged (i.e. 1 lysine, 1 arginine, 4 glutamic acid, and 2 aspartic acid), 4 polar (i.e. 1 threonine, 1 serine, 1 glutamine, and 1 asparagine), and 7 non-polar (i.e. 2 proline, 2 leucine, 1 methionine, 1 glycine, and 1 isoleucine). The low hydrophobicity suggests the region may be surface accessible to proteases or for protein-protein interaction with other proteins such as molecular chaperones, trafficking proteins, or components of proteolytic systems.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Alignment of the PEST region of CFTR.</bold> The top line is the human PEST sequence used in the study. A cross-species alignment of the CFTR amino acid sequences from residues 716 to 734 of the human CFTR shows great conservation in the region. Discrepancies with the human CFTR are noted in italics. Significant PEST residues are noted with asteriks. The PEST region is in the Regulatory (R) domain of CFTR.

An A52 epitope was also appended at the COOH-terminus for detecting transfected CFTR as opposed to endogenous CFTR. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> lists the mutants with their sequences and PEST scores as determined by the algorithm, PESTFind. The mutants' PEST scores range from being poor PEST candidates (+4.07 for S728A and -26.19 for poly-valine) to being invalid PEST candidates (i.e. no score available). We were particularly interested in the stretch of polar and PEST-significant region, residues 725 to 731. For that region, we made a poly-valine mutant where we mutated the 6 consecutive polar/charged residues (725 &#x02013; 730) to valine, a relatively small, neutral residue. This minimized the hydrophobicity of the PEST region and removed the majority of the significant PEST residues; the proline residue 731 was not altered because it may be important structurally (i.e. for formation of a &#x003b2;-turn). The E725K/E726K mutant was included to test if alteration of charges would affect the function of the PEST sequence. Since serine and threonine are often implicated in functional group modification such as phosphorylation, their role in the PEST sequence was examined. S728 and T717 were both altered to alanine, a small, neutral residue; S728A has PEST score of +4.07. However, since both S728A and T717A mutant have a high PEST score (T717A mutant alone has PEST score of +3.87), we added an additional E725K mutation to the T717A mutant just to further disrupt the PEST sequence. The mutants were also made in WT background. The WT-background constructs were included to ensure that the mutations themselves did not contribute to additional deleterious effects on the protein.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Mutations introduced into the predicted PEST sequence of CFTR</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center"><bold>Mutant</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Sequence</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>PEST Score</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">Wild-type (WT)</td><td align="center">716 &#x02013; KTPLQMNGIEEDSDEPLER &#x02013; 734</td><td align="center">+6.91</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Poly-Valine</td><td align="center">716 &#x02013; KTPLQMNGI<bold>VVVVVV</bold>PLER &#x02013; 734</td><td align="center">-26.19</td></tr><tr><td align="center">E725K/E726K</td><td align="center">716 &#x02013; KTPLQMNGI<bold>KK</bold>DSDEPLER &#x02013; 734</td><td align="center">N/A</td></tr><tr><td align="center">S728A</td><td align="center">716 &#x02013; KTPLQMNGIEED<bold>A</bold>DEPLER &#x02013; 734</td><td align="center">+4.07</td></tr><tr><td align="center">T717A/E725K</td><td align="center">716 &#x02013; K<bold>A</bold>PLQMNGI<bold>K</bold>EDSDEPLER &#x02013; 734</td><td align="center">N/A</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>* Residues in bold are the mutations introduced.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Expression of PEST mutants</title><p>The cDNAs encoding the PEST mutants were transiently transfected into COS-1 cells. The transfected cells were harvested and lysed 3 days post-transfection, separated by electrophoresis and subjected to Western blotting using a mouse monoclonal antibody against the A52 tag [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] attached at the COOH-terminus of the protein. The two N-glycosylation sites on the putative extracellular loop 4 of CFTR (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) enable us to determine the maturation state of CFTR. During its synthesis in the ER, two carbohydrate moieties are covalently attached onto the two N-glycosylation sites; this is the immature, core-glycosylated CFTR. The carbohydrate moieties are modified only upon the nascent polypeptide's maturation and progression through the Golgi apparatus onto the cell surface; this is the mature, fully-glycosylated CFTR. The modification of the carbohydrate moieties lead to a shift in the protein's apparent molecular mass: the core-glycosylated ER-resident CFTR has an apparent molecular mass of ~140 kDa while the fully-glycosylated CFTR expressed on the cell surface has an apparent molecular weight of ~170 kDa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. While glycosylation of CFTR is not crucial in the maturation CFTR, it serves as an indicator of CFTR's maturation state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>As shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, the mutants had no apparent effect on the maturation of CFTR with the exception of the poly-valine mutant. The WT background constructs, except the poly-valine mutant, all have similar levels of expression and maturation as the WT CFTR. The poly-valine construct in WT background is processing defective, similar to the &#x00394;F508 mutant. All of the &#x00394;F508 background mutants had no apparent effect on the maturation state of &#x00394;F508 CFTR and are all immature. An over-exposure of the immunoblot (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>), however, suggests removal of a protease site by the poly-valine mutations. Since we do not see any larger fragments (&#x0003e;100 kDa) in the poly-valine mutants, it is also possible that the poly-valine mutations introduced additional cleavage sites in the R domain. As shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, the 100 kDa degradation product that is present in &#x00394;F508 is absent in the poly-valine constructs, both of the WT and &#x00394;F508 background.

COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with the various constructs for 3 days prior to the pulse-chase experiments. For the pulse-chase experiment, the cells were starved for 30 minutes in sulfur-minus (S<sup>-</sup>) media depleted of methionine and cysteine. The cells were then pulsed in S<sup>-</sup> media supplemented with radiolabeled methionine for 30 minutes. The cells were then chased for 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours in plain media. At each chase point, the cells were harvested and frozen in plain media containing 10% DMSO and stored in a -70&#x000b0;C freezer. After harvesting all the time points, the cells were lysed, immunoprecipitated with mouse anti-A52 antibody, separated by electrophoresis and detected by autoradiograph.

The trypsin-sensitivity assay is based on the rationale that trypsin-sensitivity of the various constructs depend on the exposure of trypsin-sensitive sites. It has been previously established that neither the subcellular location nor the glycosylation state of CFTR has a significant effect on its trypsin sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Crude membranes were made from transiently transfected cells. The membranes were treated with various concentrations of trypsin at room temperature for 5 minutes. The reactions were stopped by the addition of lima bean trypsin inhibitor. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot with anti-A52 antibody. As shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, mature CFTR were about 100&#x02013;1000 fold more resistant to trypsin than the immature ER-resident CFTR. Thus, with the exception of the poly-valine mutant with WT background, the PEST sequence-disrupting mutants did not have any apparent effect on the folding pattern of the CFTR protein.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Trypsin Sensitivity of CFTR PEST Mutants.</bold> Membranes were prepared from COS-1 cells transiently transfected with the cDNA of the various constructs.

COS-1 cells transiently transfected with various cDNA of the PEST constructs were treated with 2 &#x003bc;M of MG-132. MG-132 is a potent peptide aldehyde inhibitor designed to enter mammalian cells to inhibit the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. As shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, MG-132 blocks the maturation of WT CFTR and WT-background mutants.

So far, not much is known about the actual mechanism of how these misprocessed CFTR are retained in the ER and targeted for degradation. Many lines of evidence have suggested the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, which includes the ubiquitin-protease pathway, as the dominant pathway for the disposal of misfolded CFTR in mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Misfolded or misassembled proteins, such as processing defective &#x00394;F508 mutant CFTR, are recognized and retained in the ER by the quality control system in the ER; although the exact mechanism for recognition is yet to be elucidated, evidence indicate that the prolonged association with molecular chaperones may play a role in the retention of CFTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Ubiquitination, the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to a lysyl &#x003b5;-amino group of the polypeptide, is necessary for degradation by the 26S proteasome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Ubiquitin is a highly conserved polypeptide of 76 amino acids. CFTR may be both co- and post-translationally ubiquitinated in cell-free systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Although the precise mechanism is still unclear, ubiquitination and ER retention eventually lead to the retrotranslocation of the misfolded protein back into the cytosol via the sec61p translocon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The misfolded protein is then targeted for degradation by the 26S proteasome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>There are still many questions about the ERAD pathway and the maturation process of WT CFTR: 1) Although the mechanism for the ubiquitination reaction is well understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], the recognition determinants for ubiquitination are still unknown. 2) How does the ERAD pathway recognize the misfolded protein? 3) Although both WT and &#x00394;F508 CFTR are ubiquitinated, how is some WT CFTR still able to progress onto the post-ER compartments of the secretory pathway? In a recent report, CHIP, an Hsc70 co-chaperone was actually found to target immature CFTR for proteasomal degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. It is likely that there are other chaperones that function in a similar manner. So, what are the selective molecular determinants for chaperones such as the CHIP to target only immature CFTR but not the mature form? Furthermore, it is the general consensus that there must be a number of criteria for exiting the ER and progressing through the secretory pathway for expression on the cell surface. Peptide motifs and signals may be exposed or buried depending on the folding state of the protein, thus providing the cell with a means of quality control. The perfect example is the four arginine-framed trafficking signals in CFTR discovered by Chang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The arginine-framed trafficking signal, however, may just be one of the many types of signals.</p><p>There are a number of peptide motifs identified in rapidly degraded proteins that target proteins for rapid degradation: PEST regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], lysosome-targeting KFERQ motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], and the cyclin destruction box responsible for eukaryotic cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The PEST region is of particular interest to us because it has been found in many rapidly-degraded proteins and shown to contribute to their degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Although the presence of PEST motifs does not necessarily lead to constitutive degradation of the protein, there were a number of reasons why we thought it was worth investigating. Aside from its proteolytic roles, PEST motifs have also been found to be involved in protein-protein interactions: direct interaction with ubc9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and ligand recognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The PEST region of CFTR lies within its R domain, which is not present in its processing efficient sister protein, P-glycoprotein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Thus, apart from a potential proteolytic site, the PEST region in CFTR also has the potential to interact with ubiquitination proteins, other proteases, or molecular chaperones. We were interested in seeing if it affects the maturation, folding, and stability of the CFTR protein. To this end, a number of constructs were made via site-directed mutagenesis aiming to disrupt the PEST region and examine the stability and folding pattern of the constructs.</p><p>To narrow the scope of our study in this paper, we tested the PEST sequence's potential role as a proteolytic site in misprocessed CFTR. A number of mutants were made to disrupt the PEST sequence in the processing defective &#x00394;F508 CFTR mutant in an attempt to rescue it. The mutants' stability and maturation was examined via pulse-chase experiments and their global structure compared by testing their trypsin sensitivity. Overall, it was found that perturbation to the PEST sequence (residues 716 &#x02013; 734) of CFTR made no apparent improvement on the stability of &#x00394;F508 CFTR.</p><p>In our survey of PEST-disrupting mutants, we included the WT-background mutants as well as the processing defective &#x00394;F508-background mutants as a control to ensure the missense mutations themselves did not cause other deleterious effect on the protein. The misprocessed poly-valine construct proves this precaution to be necessary.</p><p>The observation that poly-valine caused defective processing came as a surprise since the R domain has been previously shown to be predominantly random coil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Although the boundaries of the R domain are still not precisely defined, the R domain extends approximately from residues 634&#x02013;708 at the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminus to approximately 835 at the COOH-terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Various studies have shown that the deletion of the R-domain yields cell surface expressing, functional CFTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Furthermore, of the 19 disease-associated mutations in the R-domain examined by Vankeerberghen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], none of the clinical missense mutations studied within the boundaries of the R domain (residues 634 &#x02013; 835) was processing defective. Thus, it appeared that the R-domain did not contain significant structural information.</p><p>However, the fact that the poly valine mutant used in our study leads to such dramatic disturbance as to cause the mutant protein to not mature suggests otherwise. Using a web-based secondary structure prediction program, NNPREDICT <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cmpharm.ucsf.edu/~nomi/nnpredict"/>, the PEST region and surrounding regions (residues 712&#x02013;737) contain turning elements, with 3 helical elements. With the PEST region's low hydrophobicity, the region is likely to be surface-accessible. The poly-valine mutant, however, introduces beta strand elements in the middle of the turning elements. This could have led to disruption of a turn, and thus disrupting global structure. If the primary sequence around the PEST region does indeed carry structural information, perturbation of the PEST region by the other mutations might have also led to structural change and the trypsin assay might not be sensitive enough to detect them. These structural changes might have led to exposure of other proteolytic sites to counter the loss of proteolytic effect caused by alternation of the PEST sequence, hence, no apparent improvement in stability. An alternative test of structural change would be to find cysteine cross-linking pairs in CFTR and test if they still exist in the mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. This would act as an additional structural check of the mutants.</p><p>The PEST region may still interact with other proteins. The c-Myb transcription factor is a highly regulated nuclear phosphoprotein involved in the regulation of proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis of immature hematopoietic cells. Its activity and proteolytic stability are, in part, regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. c-Myb contains a PEST motif in its regulatory domain at its COOH-terminus. The PEST motif was found to directly interact with Ubc9. Ubc9 covalently attaches SUMO-1 protein, an ubiquitin-like protein, onto the lysyl residue near the PEST motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Similarly, Ubc9 interacts with the PEST region of another nuclear SUMO-1 target protein, HIPK2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Deletion of the PEST motif, however, does not increase the stability of the protein, suggesting other additional factors may contribute to the proteolytic stability of the proteins.</p><p>There are a number of lysyl residues to the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminus of the PEST region and may act as potential candidates for ubiquitination. If CFTR's PEST motif also acts as a binding site for ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes like Ubc9 was for SUMO-1, that would explain why no difference was observed in the treatment of proteasome inhibitors between the WT and PEST mutants; the PEST motif would be part of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and not a separate proteolytic pathway. A potential candidate may be the Ubc6, an ER-resident ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. In a recent report, mutation in Ubc6 was able increase the stability of &#x00394;F508 CFTR by 2 fold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results suggest the PEST region in the R domain of CFTR plays no discernible role in degradation of CFTR and that there may be structural information encoded in the R domain as mutations in the region may lead to misprocessing of the protein. The issue of whether CFTR's PEST motif can act as a recognition site, for other proteins, however, has not yet been addressed. As retention and degradation of misfolded CFTR is likely a collective work by many protein complexes, a survey of components of the proteolytic systems, molecular chaperones may yield more insight into the whether PEST motif plays a role in the degradation of CFTR.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Construction of mutants</title><p>The CFTR point mutations were constructed and inserted into the mammalian expression vectors pMT21 as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].

Briefly, for each CFTR construct, 20 (100 mm) tissue culture plates of transfected COS-1 cells were harvested and washed with PBS (phosphate-buffered saline). The cell pellets were subsequently resuspended in 3 ml of low ionic strength buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>). After incubating on ice for 20 min., the samples were homogenized using 40 strokes in a loose fitting Dounce homogenizer, followed by 20 strokes after addition of 3 ml of sucrose buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mM sucrose, 0.3 M KCl). The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 3000 &#x000d7; <italic>g</italic> for 7 min. at 4&#x000b0;C.

The reactions were stopped by the addition of 2 mg/ml lima bean trypsin inhibitor (Worthington). The vesicles were solubilized with 2X sample buffer (3% SDS, 5% &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8). The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis using mouse A52 monoclonal antibody as the primary antibody and a horseradish peroxidase labeled goat anti-mouse antibody as the secondary antibody.

At 72 hours post-transfection, the cells were starved for 40 minutes in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) without L-methionine or L-cystine (Invitrogene Life Technologies).
