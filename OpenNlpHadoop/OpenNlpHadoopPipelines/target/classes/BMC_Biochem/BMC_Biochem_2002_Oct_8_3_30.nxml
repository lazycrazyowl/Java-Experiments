These lipid metabolites play a role in acute inflammatory responses and also regulate normal physiological processes. Certain prostaglandins are required for female reproduction and kidney function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Because of its important role in controlling levels of arachidonic acid (AA), much attention has been focused on the regulation of cPLA<sub>2</sub> activation, with particular emphasis on the role of its phosphorylation and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated translocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>cPLA<sub>2</sub> is regulated by controlling its cellular localization and access to membrane-phospholipid substrate. An amino terminal, calcium-dependent lipid binding (CaLB or C2) domain regulates Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated cPLA<sub>2</sub> translocation to intracellular membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In vitro, membrane docking via the C2 domain is necessary and sufficient for catalysis and release of AA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Binding of calcium ions by the cPLA<sub>2</sub> C2 domain is essential for the lipid association in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and translocation in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In response to an increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, cPLA<sub>2</sub> translocates to the Golgi and ER, however translocation to Golgi occurs at a lower [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Protein kinase pathways play major roles in cPLA<sub>2</sub> activation, and regulation by the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) /extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway has received particular attention. cPLA<sub>2</sub> is phosphorylated by mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinases, including p42/p44 ERKs and p38, on Ser<sup>505</sup> in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and in response to receptor stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In addition to phosphorylation by MAP kinase, it has been shown that cPLA<sub>2</sub> is also phosphorylated on Ser<sup>727</sup> by MAPK-interacting kinase I (MNKI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and on Ser<sup>515</sup> by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Phosphorylation of these sites may also play a role in regulating cPLA<sub>2</sub> function in certain cell models.</p><p>Phosphorylation of Ser<sup>505</sup> has been extensively studied because it is readily detected due to a characteristic electrophoretic mobility shift when analyzed by SDS-PAGE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The importance of Ser<sup>505</sup> phosphorylation in regulating cPLA<sub>2</sub> has been demonstrated in different cells and in vitro models by using cPLA<sub>2</sub> containing a S505A mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. However, the mechanism whereby Ser<sup>505</sup> phosphorylation regulates cPLA<sub>2</sub> function has been elusive. In vitro studies have demonstrated that dephosphorylated cPLA<sub>2</sub> is catalytically active and that Ser<sup>505</sup> phosphorylation increases activity by only ~30 percent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In contrast, cells expressing the cPLA<sub>2</sub> S505A mutation fail to release AA in response to a low dose of calcium ionophore, but release similar amounts of AA as cells expressing wild-type cPLA<sub>2</sub> in response to high dose ionophore [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. From these studies, it has been suggested that cPLA<sub>2</sub> Ser<sup>505</sup> phosphorylation may have a role in regulating translocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. A previous study demonstrated translocation of cPLA<sub>2</sub> S505A in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore, but did not address the kinetics of translocation, translocation in response to a physiological agonist, or differences in targeting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>To better understand the regulation of cPLA<sub>2</sub> by the MEK1/ERK pathway and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, we investigated the effect of MEK inhibitors on AA release, cPLA<sub>2</sub> phosphorylation of Ser<sup>505</sup>, cPLA<sub>2</sub> translocation kinetics, and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increase in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. We found that inhibition of MEK1 by U0126 significantly inhibited AA release and this was correlated with inhibition of ERK activation. However, MEK inhibition only partially affected cPLA<sub>2</sub> phosphorylation and had no effect on the kinetics of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated cPLA<sub>2</sub> translocation to membrane. In addition, using cells expressing wild-type cPLA<sub>2</sub> and cPLA<sub>2</sub> with S505A or S727A mutations, it was found that translocation kinetics and membrane targeting in response to ATP or ionomycin was similar to wild-type cPLA<sub>2</sub>. These data suggest that MEK1 inhibition reduces cPLA<sub>2</sub> catalytic activity and AA release independently of phosphorylation and translocation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Effect of MEK inhibition on AA release, ERK activation, and cPLA<sub>2</sub> Ser<sup>505</sup> phosphorylation</title><p>To study the role of the MEK1/ERK pathway in cPLA<sub>2</sub> activation, quiesced MDCK cells were treated with the MEK1 inhibitor U0126, and the effect on AA release, ERK activation, and cPLA<sub>2</sub> gel shift determined (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). For equivalence with the imaging studies, cells expressing EGFP-cPLA<sub>2</sub> were used in all experiments. EGFP-cPLA<sub>2</sub> was expressed to similar levels as endogenous enzyme but did not contribute significantly to AA release in stably transfected cells. However, EGFP-cPLA<sub>2</sub> is functional since it dose-dependently catalyzes release of AA when expressed in cells that lack endogenous cPLA<sub>2</sub>, such as Sf9 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and immortalized mouse lung fibroblasts from cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; knock-out mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In order to enhance AA release in cells containing endogenous cPLA<sub>2</sub>, it is necessary to over-express the enzyme several fold as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Cytosolic PLA<sub>2</sub> has been shown to mediate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced AA release in MDCK cells treated with ATP and IONO in experiments using the group IV cPLA<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1;-specific inhibitor pyrrolidine-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. To measure cPLA<sub>2</sub> mediated AA release, EGFP-cPLA<sub>2</sub>-transfected MDCK cells labeled with [<sup>3</sup>H]-AA were incubated with 0.3, 1 or 10 &#x003bc;M U0126 for 15 min prior to stimulation with 100 &#x003bc;M ATP, 1 &#x003bc;M IONO, or 10 &#x003bc;M IONO. AA release was measured at 3 min because we have shown that ATP- and IONO-stimulated AA release peaks between 3 to 5 min post-stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Agonist-induced AA release was inhibited dose-dependently by U0126 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) with the highest U0126 concentration used (10 &#x003bc;M) reducing AA release by 72&#x02013;80% with all agonists (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">I</xref>). This inhibition was independent of the total amount of AA released, since AA release stimulated by 10 &#x003bc;M IONO was 3-fold greater than release stimulated with 1 &#x003bc;M IONO or 100 &#x003bc;M ATP, but the percent inhibition by U0126 was similar. Treatment of MDCK cells with 30 &#x003bc;M PD098059, a less potent inhibitor of MEK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], resulted in a ~50% reduction in AA release in response to 100 &#x003bc;M ATP, 1 &#x003bc;M IONO, and 10 &#x003bc;M IONO (data not shown). Thus, in MDCK cells, MEK1 inhibition significantly reduces the ability of cPLA<sub>2</sub> to hydrolyze AA from membrane phospholipids.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of MEK inhibition on AA release, ERK inhibition, and cPLA<sub>2</sub> Ser<sup>505</sup> phosphorylation</bold> (A) EGFP-cPLA<sub>2</sub>-transfected cells were incubated with the indicated concentrations of U0126 for 15 min prior to stimulation with 100 &#x003bc;M ATP, 1 &#x003bc;M IONO, or 10 &#x003bc;M IONO.

Work in our laboratory has shown that recognition of ERK by anti-phospho-ERK antibodies correlates with an increase in ERK activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Interestingly, the anti-phospho-ERK immunoblots revealed that ERKs were constitutively activated in untreated, quiesced MDCK cells and activation was not enhanced further by ATP or IONO (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, left panel). ERK activation was diminished by increasing concentrations of U0126 and was quantitatively inhibited after 15 min incubation in 10 &#x003bc;M U0126. U0126 decreased ERK activation following ATP or IONO stimulation in the same fashion as in unstimulated cells. Consequently, there was a direct correlation between the reduction of AA release (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) and inhibition of ERK activation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) in MDCK cells treated with U0126.</p><p>Because cPLA<sub>2</sub> is a target of the MEK1/ERK signaling cascade, we assayed the effect of MEK1 inhibition by U0126 on cPLA<sub>2</sub> phosphorylation by analyzing gel shift of cPLA<sub>2</sub>. Phosphorylation of Ser<sup>505</sup> results in a retardation of its electrophoretic mobility (gel shift) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In unstimulated cells, EGFP-tagged and endogenous cPLA<sub>2</sub> were nearly completely gel shifted, indicating that most cPLA<sub>2</sub> was phosphorylated on Ser<sup>505</sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), which is consistent with the observation that ERKs are constitutively activated. Incubation with U0126 resulted in a partial reversal of the gel shift although, at 10 &#x003bc;M U0126, approximately half of cPLA<sub>2</sub> remained phosphorylated on Ser<sup>505</sup>. Thus, unlike the quantitative effect of U0126 on ERK activation, inhibition of MEK1 with U0126 only partially reversed the gel shift of cPLA<sub>2</sub>. The reversal of the gel shift was similar in cells treated with ATP and 1 and 10 &#x003bc;M IONO. Due to the increased molecular weight of the EGFP-tagged cPLA<sub>2</sub>, the two forms of cPLA<sub>2</sub> did not separate as well, making the gel shift more difficult to visualize, but generally mirrored the gel shift characteristics of the endogenous cPLA<sub>2</sub>. These results suggest that, in response to MEK1 inhibition, there is a quantitative, dose-dependent decrease in AA release that correlates well with the loss of ERK activation, but not with the extent of cPLA<sub>2</sub> Ser<sup>505</sup> phosphorylation.</p><p>To further investigate whether the MEK1/ERK pathway played a role in regulating AA release independent of Ser<sup>505</sup> phosphorylation, we treated cells with anisomycin, which activates the MAPK homolog p38, but not the MEK1/ERK pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Activation of p38 in response to anisomycin treatment was analyzed by immunoblotting using an anti-phospho-p38 antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The immunoblots demonstrate that 30 min treatment in 25 ng/ml anisomycin resulted in phosphorylation of p38 in unstimulated MDCK cells and in cells treated with ATP or IONO. ATP and ionomycin treatment in the absence of anisomycin only weakly increased p38 phosphorylation. As expected, the MEK inhibitor U0126 did not significantly affect anisomycin-stimulated p38 phosphorylation. In control experiments, anisomycin treatment did not induce ERK activation nor interfere with inhibition of ERK activation by 10 &#x003bc;M U0126 treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). We have previously reported that p38 is also selectively activated in anisomycin-treated macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Importantly, pretreatment of cells for 30 min with anisomycin resulted in maintenance of the cPLA<sub>2</sub> gel shift in the presence of U0126 in unstimulated cells and in cells stimulated with ATP and 1 and 10 &#x003bc;M IONO (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). AA release assays show that, in MDCK cells treated with anisomycin, U0126 resulted in an AA release reduction of ~67&#x02013;76% (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>) similar to the inhibition observed without anisomycin. These results demonstrate that activation of the MEK1/ERK pathway is required for AA release even under conditions where cPLA<sub>2</sub> Ser<sup>505</sup> phosphorylation is maintained, suggesting an alternative role for the MEK1/ERK pathway in regulating cPLA<sub>2</sub>.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of anisomycin and U0126 on AA release, ERK inhibition, and cPLA<sub>2</sub> Ser<sup>505</sup> phosphorylation</bold> EGFP-cPLA<sub>2</sub>-transfected cells were incubated with 25 ng/ml anisomycin for 30 min, 10 &#x003bc;M U0126 for 15 min, or with both drugs prior to stimulation with 100 &#x003bc;M ATP, 1 &#x003bc;M IONO, or 10 &#x003bc;M IONO.

In chick ventricular myocytes, inhibition of MEK1/ERK by PD98059 inhibits zinterol-mediated AA release, but also inhibits zinterol-induced stimulation of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> cycling in electrically stimulated cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In MDCK cells, extracellular ATP acts via P<sub>2Y2</sub> receptors to elicit an IP<sub>3</sub>-mediated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and IONO acts to increase [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> by permeabilizing cell membranes to Ca<sup>2+</sup>. To determine the effect of U0126 on intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization by 100 &#x003bc;M ATP or 10 &#x003bc;M IONO, we utilized single-cell fluorescence microscopy on cells loaded with the calcium indicator Fura2. Analysis of the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increase in individual cells reveals the heterogeneity in the response to ATP, although most cells exhibited [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> spikes of similar magnitude and duration (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, thin lines). Analysis of the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increase in several cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, thick line) revealed that although the duration of the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increase elicited by ATP in control cells was the same as in the U0126-treated cells, approximately 3&#x02013;4 min, the amplitude of the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increase was slightly higher (~20%) in the U0126-treated cells.

Although there is no inhibition of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> release by U0126 and little effect on Ser<sup>505</sup> phosphorylation, it is possible that MEK1 inhibition by U0126 prevents cPLA<sub>2</sub> translocation by another mechanism. To investigate this possibility, cells were transfected with a wild-type cPLA<sub>2</sub> fused to EYFP (EYFP-cPLA<sub>2</sub>) and the distribution of EYFP-cPLA<sub>2</sub> was imaged in response to [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> transients elicited by ATP and sustained [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> elevations elicited by IONO, in the presence and absence of U0126.

MDCK cells were co-transfected with EYFP-cPLA<sub>2</sub> and a cPLA<sub>2</sub> with a S505A mutation fused to ECFP (ECFP-cPLA<sub>2</sub>S505A). Using dual EYFP/ECFP imaging, we were able to directly compare translocation of both constructs in the same cell. The resting distribution of EYFP-cPLA<sub>2</sub> was similar to that of ECFP-cPLA<sub>2</sub>S505A and, in response to ATP followed by IONO, the pattern of translocation of EYFP-cPLA<sub>2</sub> was similar to ECFP-cPLA<sub>2</sub>S505A (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> panels A and B, D).

The results of this study demonstrate that this pathway is required for cPLA<sub>2</sub>-mediated AA release independent of Ser<sup>505</sup> phosphorylation and extend our previous work in macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] by demonstrating that this alternative role of the MEK1/ERK pathway is not involved in regulating [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> change or cPLA<sub>2</sub> translocation kinetics or targeting, but is required for optimal hydrolytic activity and AA release.</p><p>The results shown here demonstrate that inhibition of MEK with U0126 quantitatively inhibits both ERK phosphorylation and AA release in MDCK cells in response to [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> mobilization. The MEK inhibitor PD098059, a less potent inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], also inhibited ATP- and IONO-induced AA release (data not shown). ERK was found to be constitutively phosphorylated in our study using MDCK cells from ATCC, in contrast to what has been reported previously for MDCK-D<sub>1</sub>, a subclone of MDCK selected for adrenergic receptor expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. However, a side-by-side comparison of MDCK cells from ATCC and the MDCK-D<sub>1</sub> subclone (kindly provided by Dr. Paul Insel, UCSD) demonstrated constitutive activation of ERKs when both are grown at low density (not shown). However, at high density ERKs are less active and can be further activated by phorbol ester (not shown).</p><p>In MDCK-D<sub>1</sub> cells, without constitutively active ERKs, AA release is delayed after [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> mobilization, and is temporally correlated with ERK activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], whereas in MDCK cells with constitutively active ERKs, AA release is rapid, with significant AA release measured 30 s after [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. This temporal correlation between AA release and ERK activation has also been reported in CHO cells in response to PAF stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. These results support the observations made here that ERK activity is required for phospholipid hydrolysis independently of cPLA<sub>2</sub> translocation.</p><p>cPLA<sub>2</sub>-mediated AA release must be preceded by translocation of the enzyme to its membrane substrate which is a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent process and is a function of the calcium-dependent lipid-binding (C2) domain. cPLA<sub>2</sub> translocates primarily to Golgi in response to a transient [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> changes and to Golgi and ER in response to a sustained [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The reduction in AA release by MEK inhibition did not involve a failure in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> release or translocation. These results show that translocation is necessary but not sufficient for optimum hydrolytic activity.</p><p>Measuring cPLA<sub>2</sub> translocation is not a trivial matter when investigating mechanisms of AA release. For example, cPLA<sub>2</sub> constructs with a S505A mutation have long been recognized as unable to support AA release in response to physiological agonists or low-dose ionophore when transfected in cells. In contrast, cPLA<sub>2</sub> S505A is active in vitro and phosphorylation only modestly increases the activity of the enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Interestingly, the inhibitory effect of the S505A mutation on AA release is obviated by a high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increase. In light of these observations, it is possible that Ser<sup>505</sup> phosphorylation may alter the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> sensitivity of the enzyme, its rate of translocation, its intracellular targeting or, as has been previously suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], the ability of cPLA<sub>2</sub> to release from a non-membrane sequestering agent. Although one report has shown that cPLA<sub>2</sub> S505A translocates in CHO cells in response to ionophore, we were able to directly compare rates of translocation between cPLA<sub>2</sub> and cPLA<sub>2</sub> S505A to a physiological agonist and found no difference between translocation rates or intracellular targeting. We also demonstrated that there was no difference in translocation rates or intracellular targeting between wild-type cPLA<sub>2</sub> and cPLA<sub>2</sub> S727A, which has the same phenotype as S505A with regard to AA release when transfected into cells. Thus, the role of cPLA<sub>2</sub> phosphorylation in mediating AA release remains unclear.</p><p>Although the alternative mechanism whereby the MEK1/ERK pathway regulates cPLA<sub>2</sub> is not known, it is possible that it affects membrane properties and/or cPLA<sub>2</sub> conformation that promotes optimal hydrolytic activity. It is also possible that the alternative mechanism is due to phosphorylation of cPLA<sub>2</sub> on a novel site by a kinase that is downstream of the MEK1/ERK pathway or phosphorylation of a regulatory protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Translocation to membrane is a critical regulatory step for the action of cPLA<sub>2</sub> because it is necessary for access to substrate. In this study we demonstrate, however, that association of cPLA<sub>2</sub> with membrane when phosphorylated on Ser<sup>505</sup> is not sufficient for its full activity in vivo. This is demonstrated by the results showing that inhibition of the MEK1/ERK pathway significantly blocks AA release but has no effect on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> mobilization or cPLA<sub>2</sub> translocation and targeting. Diminution of AA release by MEK1/ERK is also independent of cPLA<sub>2</sub> phosphorylation on Ser<sup>505</sup>. Consequently, our results demonstrate in living cells that the translocation process and subsequent catalytic activity on the membrane are two independently regulated steps.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Fluorescent protein-cPLA<sub>2</sub> fusion constructs</title><p>DNA encoding the full-length human cPLA<sub>2</sub> was cloned into the vector pEGFP-C3 (Clontech) to create pEGFP-cPLA<sub>2</sub>, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].
