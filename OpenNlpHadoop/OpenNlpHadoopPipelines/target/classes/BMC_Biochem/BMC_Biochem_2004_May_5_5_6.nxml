In this organism, these two reactions are feedback inhibited by the end product UTP. In the present work, the mechanisms of these integrated inhibitions were studied.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The results obtained show that the inhibition is competitive in the case of carbamylphosphate synthetase and non-competitive in the case of aspartate transcarbamylase. They also identify the substrate whose binding is altered by this nucleotide and the step of the carbamylphosphate synthetase reaction which is inhibited. Furthermore, the structure of the domains catalyzing these two reactions were modelled in order to localize the mutations which, specifically, alter the aspartate transcarbamylase sensitivity to the feedback inhibitor UTP. Taken together, the results make it possible to propose a model for the integrated regulation of the two activities of the complex. UTP binds to a regulatory site located in the vicinity of the carbamylphosphate synthetase catalytic subsite which catalyzes the third step of this enzyme reaction. Through a local conformational change, this binding decreases, competitively, the affinity of this site for the substrate ATP. At the same time, through a long distance signal transmission process it allosterically decreases the affinity of the aspartate transcarbamylase catalytic site for the substrate aspartate.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This investigation provides informations about the mechanisms of allosteric inhibition of the two activities of the CPSase-ATCase complex. Although many allosteric monofunctional enzymes were studied, this is the first report on integrated allosteric regulation in a multifunctional protein. The positions of the point mutations which specifically abolish the sensitivity of aspartate transcarbamylase to UTP define an interface between the carbamylphosphate synthetase and aspartate transcarbamylase domains, through which the allosteric signal for the regulation of aspartate transcarbamylase must be propagated.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Although numerous allosteric enzymes were studied, much less information is available concerning the coordinated regulation of activities in multienzymatic complexes. Two feedback inhibited multienzyme complexes were studied in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the N-acetylglutamate synthase/N-acetyl glutamate kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and the carbamylphosphate synthetase &#x02013; aspartate transcarbamylase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] complexes.</p><p>In procaryotes the first three reactions of the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway are catalyzed by independent enzymes namely carbamylphosphate synthetase (CPSase, EC 2.7.2.9), aspartate transcarbamylase (ATCase, EC 2.1.3.2), and dihydroorotase (DHOase, EC 3.5.2.3). <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>CPSase is feedback inhibited by UMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and ATCase by CTP and UTP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In contrast, in mammals these three reactions are catalyzed by an hexameric 240-kDa multifunctional protein, the protein CAD, made of covalently linked domains, each one catalyzing one of these reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In this case, only CPSase is regulated, being feedback inhibited by UTP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. An interesting intermediary organisation is observed in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. In this case a 240-kDa bifunctional protein encoded by the URA2 locus possesses the CPSase and ATCase activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] but lacks the DHOase activity, although it contains an inactive pseudo-DHOase (pDHO) domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] homologous to the functional DHOases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In this organism both CPSase and ATCase are feedback inhibited by UTP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Similarly to what is observed in CAD, this yeast multifunctional protein is organized into four major functional domains:</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Organization and allosteric regulatory properties of the enzymes catalyzing the first three reactions of the pyrimidine pathway in <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>and mammals. </bold>This scheme shows the functional domains that catalyze the first steps in the <italic>de novo </italic>pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway, the amidotransferase or glutaminase domain (GLNase), the CPSase synthetase domain consisting of two subdomains (CPS-A and CPS-B), the dihydroorotase domain (DHOase), and the ATCase domain. The activities are associated with separate polypeptide chains in <italic>E. coli</italic>, whereas in mammals (CAD) all are consolidated on a single multifunctional protein. In yeast, the CPSase and ATCase domains are carried by a single polypeptide, but in this case the active DHOase that is encoded by a separate gene is replaced with an inactive DHOase homologue (pDHO). Eucaryotes ATCases lack the regulatory subunit (Reg) found in the <italic>E. coli </italic>protein.

In addition, the reaction step affected by the feedback inhibitor UTP was identified in both the entire complex and in the truncated protein (C<sub>B</sub>ApD). Moreover a computational approach was used to predict the structures of the CPSase and ATCase domains. The results obtained provide informations about the integrated allosteric regulation of the two enzymatic activities of the complex, and indicate that the regulatory site is located in the CPS-B domain. The modelling defines an interface between the CPSase and ATCase domains for the transmission of the allosteric signal.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Inhibition of the CPSase and ATCase activities of the complex</title><sec><title>UTP inhibition of the coupled reaction</title><p>The influence of the feedback inhibitor UTP on the <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>coupled CPSase-ATCase reaction catalyzed by the complex was determined using the wild type complex present in the URA2-EK1104 strain, and is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>.

Complete inhibition cannot be obtained and under the conditions used (50 mM aspartate) one observes a 20% residual activity.

Such a pattern is characteristic of a process of partial competitive inhibition in which the binding of the inhibitor to a site distinct from the catalytic site decreases the affinity of the active site for the substrate through a conformational change. This result is consistent with the previously reported observation that towards carbamylphosphate the inhibition by UTP is of uncompetitive type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>UTP inhibition of the <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>ATCase reaction of the CPSase-ATCase complex. </bold>The influence of UTP on the ATCase reaction of the bifunctional complex was determined as indicated in the Methods in the presence of 50 mM aspartate and 10 mM carbamylphosphate using dialyzed crude extract of the <italic>E. coli </italic>EK1104 strain transformed by pC4-URA2.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2091-5-6-3"/></fig></sec><sec><title>UTP inhibition of CPSase</title><p>Since the CPSase assay involves its coupled reaction with ATCase, in order to study specifically the influence of the feedback inhibitor on the CPSase reaction, it was necessary to use mutants in which the ATCase reaction is insensitive to this effector. Such mutants were previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and it was shown that this specific desensitization could result from single missense mutations located either in the ATCase domain or in the CPSase domain of the complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Three of these mutants were used in this study: Asn1094&#x02192;Asp located in the CPSase domain; Glu1933&#x02192;Lys and Glu2182&#x02192;Lys located in the ATCase domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Complete inhibition of the CPSase reaction by UTP was observed in the three cases, in accordance with the complete inhibition of the coupled reaction reported above. In order to investigate the nature of this inhibition and to identify the substrate(s) whose binding or utilization is altered by the effector, the influence of UTP was measured in the presence of varying concentrations of the three substrates of CPSase: ATP, glutamine, and bicarbonate. The three mutants provide the same results which are presented here in the case of Glu2182&#x02192;Lys. These results are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, where double reciprocal plots are presented on the left, and Dixon plots on the right. Taken together, these results show unambiguously that UTP acts as a competitive inhibitor towards ATP and as a non competitive inhibitor towards bicarbonate and glutamine, a pattern which indicates that UTP acts by decreasing specifically the apparent affinity of the catalytic site for ATP with a K<sub>I </sub>of 3 &#x000b1; 1 mM. These results indicate a process of absolute competitive inhibition toward ATP.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Substrate saturation curves of the CPSase from the mutant Glu 2182&#x02192;Lys in presence or absence of UTP. </bold>The CPSase activity was measured as indicated in the Methods.

Most interestingly, it appears that these mutants are clustered in a particular region of the surface of the two domains, suggesting that these two regions constitute an interface between the two domains, through which the regulatory signal from the allosteric UTP binding site located in the CPSase domain to the catalytic site of the ATCase domain should be transmitted. However one of these mutations (Phe1924&#x02192;Val) is located close to the catalytic site of ATCase suggesting that this residue would be rather involved in the transmission of the regulatory signal from the interface to the ATCase catalytic site.</p><fig position="float" id="F10"><label>Figure 10</label><caption><p><bold>Probable interface between the CPSase and ATCase domains of the <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>bifunctional complex. </bold>In green: the yeast CPSase domain.

In the case of CPSase, the results reported here indicate that the substrate whose binding is altered by this effector is ATP as shown previously in the case of <italic>E. coli </italic>CPSase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In the case of yeast ATCase, UTP decreases the affinity for the substrate aspartate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Taken together with previously published observations, the results reported here show that the feedback inhibition of the yeast complex is of absolute competitive nature in the case of CPSase and of partial competitive nature in the case of ATCase. This last behavior is characteristic of a process of allosteric inhibition in which the effector binds to a regulatory site distinct from the catalytic site. In the case of CPSase the absolute competition indicates that UTP binds close enough to directly prevent the binding of ATP to this site through a local conformational change.</p><p>Several lines of evidence show that the regulatory site where UMP (procaryote CPSases) or UTP (enkaryote CPSases) binds is localized in the B3 subdomain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Among the two steps of the CPSase reaction which, each, use a molecule of ATP (steps 1 and 3) only the third one is inhibited by UTP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). This partial reaction is specifically catalyzed by the B2 subdomain. Thus, it appears that the UTP binding site is located in the CPS-B domain which catalyzes the partial reaction which is specifically inhibited by this nucleotide, a feature which relates to the absolute competitive inhibition reported above. In the <italic>E. coli </italic>enzyme this regulatory site and the CPS-B catalytic site are distant by approximately 20 &#x000c5; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. However, in the yeast complex this distance might be lower as the result of interactions with the ATCase and pDHOase domains. Alternatively, UTP might act through a different mechanism in the yeast complex and might provoke the competitive inhibition through binding to the CPS-B ATP binding site.</p><p>The first partial reaction catalyzed by the domain A is not affected by the presence of UTP. It was shown previously that the dimer of the isolated B domain is able to catalyze the synthesis of carbamylphosphate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Interestingly, in this case, the first step of the CPSase reaction becomes sensitive to UTP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Thus, the reaction normally catalyzed by the A domain becomes sensitive to UTP when it is catalyzed by the B domain which contains the allosteric UTP binding site. Taken together, these observations indicate that although it is homologous to the B3 domain, the A3 subdomain is unable to bind UTP.</p><p>As far as the feedback inhibition of the ATCase activity is concerned, several lines of evidence show that the presence of the CPSase domain of the <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>complex is necessary for the ATCase domain to be sensitive to UTP, and that a single UTP binding site is located in the CPSase domain. Separation of the CPSase and ATCase domains by limited proteolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] or genetic engeneering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] leads to the desensitization of the ATCase domain. Taken together with the results reported here concerning the partial competitive character of the ATCase feedback inhibition, the requirement of the CPSase domain strongly suggests that the CPSase and the ATCase catalytic sites are both under the influence of the UTP binding regulatory site located in the B3 subdomain.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results obtained provide informations about the mechanisms of allosteric inhibition of the two activities of the CPSase-ATCase complex. It is of particular interest that the mutations which specifically abolish the sensitivity to UTP of the ATCase reaction, without altering the CPSase inhibition, are clustered on the surface of either the CPS-B domain or the ATCase domain. This observation strongly suggests that these two regions constitute the interface between the two domains, interface through which the regulatory signal must be transmitted from the CPSase regulatory site to the catalytic site of the ATCase domain. This transmission could involve either a specific path between this interface and the catalytic site of ATCase, or a more global conformational change of this ATCase domain leading to a decrease of the affinity of this site for aspartate.</p><p>This is an original example of integrated allosteric regulation in a multifunctional complex that the catalytic domain of one activity is the allosteric site for the other activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plasmids and strains</title><p>The 14.0-kb plasmid pC4-URA2 contains the yeast ura2 gene encoding the bifunctionnal CPSase-ATCase complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].

The partial reaction 1 of CPSase was assayed at 25&#x000b0;C by coupling the production of MgADP to the oxydation of NADH through the inclusion of pyruvate kinase, PEP, and lactate dehydrogenase in the assay mixture. Disappearance of NADH was followed continuously by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm with a strip chart recorder.
