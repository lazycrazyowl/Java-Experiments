Traditional kinase assays rely heavily on the incorporation of &#x003b3;-P<sup>32 </sup>radiolabeled isotopes, monoclonal anti-phospho-protein antibodies, or gel shift analysis of substrate proteins. In addition to the expensive and time consuming nature of these methods, the use of radio-ligands imposes restrictions based on the half-life of the radionucleotides and pose potential health risks to researchers. With the shortcomings of traditional assays in mind, the aim of this study was to develop a high throughput, non-radioactive kinase assay for screening Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3beta (GSK-3&#x003b2;) activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Synthetic peptide substrates designed with a GSK-3&#x003b2; phosphorylation site were assayed with both recombinant enzyme and GSK-3&#x003b2; immunoprecipitated from NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. A molecular weight shift equal to that of a single phosphate group (80 Da.) was detected by surface enhanced laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS) in a GSK-3&#x003b2; target peptide (2B-Sp). Not only was there a dose-dependent response in molecular weight shift to the amount of recombinant GSK-3&#x003b2; used in this assay, this shift was also inhibited by lithium chloride (LiCl), in a dose-dependent manner.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We present here a novel method to sensitively measure peptide phosphorylation by GSK-3&#x003b2; that, due to the incorporation of substrate controls, is applicable to either purified enzyme or cell extracts. Future studies using this method have the potential to elucidate the activity of GSK-3&#x003b2; <italic>in vivo</italic>, and to screen enzyme activity in relation to a variety of GSK-3&#x003b2; related disorders.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Phosphorylation is believed to be the most common protein post-translational covalent modification and is known to occur in the processing of as many as 1/3 of eukaryotic gene products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. That the mammalian genome is predicted to encode as many as 1000 different protein phosphatases and twice as many kinases underlines the importance of protein phosphorylation in cellular function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. One of the most diverse protein kinases studied to-date is the constitutively active serine/threonine kinase, Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3beta (GSK-3&#x003b2;). Originally identified for its role in the regulation of glycogen metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], it is now known that GSK-3&#x003b2; plays a key role in cellular processes as diverse as cytoskeletal regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], cell cycle progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], cell fate and specification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and transcriptional/translational initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Therefore, functional kinase activity of GSK-3&#x003b2; is important in a variety of biological and biochemical processes and altered GSK-3&#x003b2; activity can contribute to a number of pathological processes including bipolar mood disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], schizophrenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], heart disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], neurodegeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] Alzheimer's disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and diabetes mellitus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Elucidating the direct activity of GSK-3&#x003b2; phosphorylation activity <italic>in vivo </italic>is therefore important in contributing to understanding the molecular basis of a variety of disease states.</p><p>Traditionally, kinase assays are performed using radioactive isotopes and scintillation counting for determination of &#x003b3;-P<sup>32 </sup>incorporation into a substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. These methods are relatively insensitive, as they are unsuitable for screening discrete changes in enzyme activity, and are limited by radiation-induced peptide degradation and the short half-life of &#x003b3;-P<sup>32</sup>. Furthermore, exposure to radioactive isotopes poses a health risk, and thus movement towards a non-radioactive kinase assay is preferable. Existing non-radioactive kinase assays utilize band shifts on non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels and the use of monoclonal antibodies that are indirectly quantified or visualized using Western Blot analysis or immunofluorescence. Such methods are limited by the requirements of specific antibodies for well-characterized phosphorylated residues on a protein of interest, numerous incubation steps, and their time consuming nature when multiple substrates are being screened at once.</p><p>This study focuses on the development of a novel, rapid, non-radioactive method of screening GSK-3&#x003b2; activity using surface enhanced laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS). This kinase assay utilizes peptide substrates that have been designed with a well-known GSK-3&#x003b2; phosphorylation site based on the translation initiation factor eIF2B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. GSK-3&#x003b2; has an unusual preference for target proteins that have undergone a previous phospho-priming event, and the enzyme generally recognizes substrates with a Ser-Xaa-Xaa-Xaa-Ser(P) motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The synthetic substrate peptides were prepared with a serine residue at a position equivalent to the GSK-3&#x003b2; phosphorylation site on eIF2B (n), and either an alanine (2B-A), serine (2B-S) or phosphoserine (2B-Sp) at the n+4 position. The phospho-primed serine containing peptide, 2B-Sp is subject to phosphorylation by GSK-3&#x003b2;, while the serine and alanine containing peptides, 2B-S and 2B-A, remain unphosphorylated due to the lack of the phosphoserine residue requisite for GSK-3&#x003b2; phosphorylation. To broaden the applicability of this assay to cell extracts potentially containing priming kinases such as casein kinase-1, the 2B-S peptide has been incorporated as a control substrate that can be converted to 2B-Sp, and subsequently phosphorylated by GSK-3&#x003b2;.</p><p>The dual use of SELDI-TOF-MS and GSK-3&#x003b2; target peptides allows for the detection of changes in their molecular weight, or m/z ratio, when subjected to the kinase activity of GSK-3&#x003b2;. Essentially, the target peptides are added in a kinase assay with GSK-3&#x003b2; (either recombinant, or immunoprecipitated) and submitted for mass spectrometric analysis. The peptide samples are spotted on gold (Au) chips, covered with energy absorbing matrix (EAM), inserted into a PBS II ProteinChip<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Reader, and desorbed/ionized with a nitrogen-based laser. The components of the sample are then resolved based on time of flight from the chip surface to the detector, which is proportional to their mass to charge ratio (m/z) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Through the selective use of peptide substrates with predetermined mass signatures, SELDI-TOF-MS can identify when a specific peptide substrate has been phosphorylated via a mass/charge (m/z) shift of 80 Da., the molecular weight equivalent of a single phosphate group.</p><p>Although matrix assisted mass spectrometric techniques are not particularly quantitative in nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], the ability to detect and readily resolve discrete changes in molecular weight makes up for this downfall. Surface enhanced technologies utilizing chromatographic or preactivated surface chips can allow for quantitative measurement. SELDI-TOF-MS was used in this study to determine the phosphorylation status of GSK-3&#x003b2; target peptides through detection of changes in peptide m/z ratio. GSK-3&#x003b2; kinase activity can be derived from this information, an observation of enzyme activity that can only be inferred from less direct assays such as the phosphorylation state of the enzyme itself.</p><p>By capitalizing on the ease, sensitivity and reproducibility of SELDI-TOF-MS, a novel non-radioactive, mass spectrometry-based method has been developed to study phosphorylation events. This method can be used to elucidate the signaling activity of a specific kinase <italic>in vivo</italic>, and is limited only by the specificity of the kinase for its substrate peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. This kinase detection method is highly specific, and accurate protein profiles can be generated from minimal sample volumes in a short amount of time. SELDI-TOF-MS is a relatively new proteomic tool that has been used in the discovery of disease-related biomarkers in carcinomas such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], malignant prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], and ovarian neoplasms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Under the premise of this type of GSK-3&#x003b2; activity detection, it is also possible to deduce the kinase activity of GSK-3&#x003b2; in more complex cellular signaling systems.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>SELDI-TOF-MS analysis of GSK-3&#x003b2; target substrates</title><p>Parent m/z ratio peaks of GSK-3&#x003b2; target synthetic peptides, 2B-Sp, 2B-S, and 2B-A were determined by preparing samples containing untreated peptide substrates for SELDI-TOF-MS analysis.

Previous studies have determined that synthetic peptides designed with a phospho-primed serine four residues downstream of a serine residue are the most effective substrates for assaying GSK-3&#x003b2; activity <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>The eIF2B sequence-like peptide 2B-Sp and recombinant GSK-3&#x003b2; were used to optimize the conditions needed for the assay, including sample preparation, and SELDI-TOF-MS analysis. It was determined that 6.25 ng of recombinant GSK-3&#x003b2; resulted in a 80 Da. shift in molecular weight for 100% of the target serine residue in the 2B-Sp peptide and that a stepwise reduction in recombinant GSK-3&#x003b2; to 2.5 ng resulted in a dose-response reaction with respect to phosphorylation status of the peptide (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Furthermore, assays with 6.25 ng of recombinant GSK-3&#x003b2; and control peptides 2B-S and 2B-A did not produce an 80 Da. shift in m/z ratio (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). These results indicate that recombinant GSK-3&#x003b2; kinase activity was unable to phosphorylate the 2B-A control peptide and that, in the absence of priming kinases, the SB-S peptide was also an effective control for specific GSK-3&#x003b2; phosphorylation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).</p><p>To further support our findings that the 80 Da. shift in m/z ratio of the 2B-Sp peptide was due to the addition of a phosphate moiety and the result of GSK-3&#x003b2; activity, inhibitory assays were performed. An established inhibitor of GSK-3&#x003b2;, lithium chloride (LiCl), and a non inhibitor control salt, sodium chloride (NaCl) were added to subsequent assays. Increasing concentrations of LiCl inhibited the 80 Da. shift in molecular weight in a dose-dependent manner (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). In contrast, NaCl was shown to be ineffective in altering the m/z ratio of the target serine on the 2B-Sp peptide (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), confirming LiCl specific inhibition of GSK-3&#x003b2; kinase activity.</p><p>Although an 80 Da. shift in molecular weight of the 2B-Sp peptide is consistent with a phosphorylation event catalyzed by GSK-3&#x003b2;, traditional &#x003b3;-P<sup>32 </sup>assays were performed to confirm the incorporation of a phosphate group into the target peptide. Scintillation counting confirmed the incorporation of &#x003b3;-P<sup>32 </sup>into the 2B-Sp peptide but not the 2B-S and 2B-A controls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Similarly, the addition of LiCl inhibited GSK-3&#x003b2; kinase activity on the 2B-Sp peptide (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p><p>Having validated our method of screening GSK-3&#x003b2; activity by showing specificity for the target peptide used and that this method is capable of detecting changes in enzyme activity, we further validated this system for use in a biological model. Serum-starved NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were lysed and GSK-3&#x003b2; was immunoprecipitated. Enzyme activity was assessed in the same manner as described previously for recombinant purified GSK-3&#x003b2;. As shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, immunoprecipitated cell lysates from fibroblasts display a large 2063.2 Da. peak and a smaller but clearly detectable peak at 2143.2 Da. corresponding to non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated 2B-Sp peptide respectively. Relative quantitation of areas under the peaks from three replicate experiments indicated that 23.0% +/- 3.5% of the 2B-Sp peptide had been phosphorylated. This demonstrates that this assay system is applicable to biological systems where the sensitive detection of changes in GSK-3&#x003b2; activity is required. In contrast, the 2B-S peptide control remained at its original molecular weight of 1983.2 Da. indicating that there was no detectable contamination from priming kinases in the immunoprecipitated lysates. The 2B-A peptide remained at original molecular weight of 1967.2 Da. in all samples indicating that there were no other, less specific kinases contaminating the immunoprecipitates and that both 2B-A and 2B-S peptides are effective controls for this assay.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The kinase activity detection method developed in this study has applications outside of its use for screening GSK-3&#x003b2; activity. The versatility of this method lies in the simplicity of its design: employing the use of mass spectrometry to detect small changes of molecular weight in peptide substrates specific for a protein kinase of interest. If target peptide substrates can be synthesized with a sequence specific for the protein kinase (or phosphatase) of interest, this method is applicable to virtually any signaling pathway in which kinase activity and phosphorylation play a role.</p><p>This report describes in general terms the components required and sensitivity of this SELDI-TOF assay for GSK3&#x003b2; activity. It is emphasized that cell-type specific optimization is required to utilize this assay system. Immunoprecipitation of cell lysates is a necessary and essential component of this assay as it facilitates the measurement of GSK3&#x003b2; activity specifically and, ideally, in the absence of interfering factors such as priming kinases. Optimal conditions for immunoprecipitation are necessary to achieve target specificity as well as reproducible and sensitive detection of changes in GSK3&#x003b2; activity.</p><p>The demonstration of altered GSK-3&#x003b2; kinase activity in a variety of pathologies related to fibroproliferative disease lead to its selection for this study. Not only is GSK-3&#x003b2; activity implicated in a variety of developmental, cell signaling, and regulatory mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], dysfunctional GSK-3&#x003b2; activity is now being explored in Alzheimer's disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], and in our laboratory, Dupuytren's contracture, a fibroproliferative disease whose molecular pathology is not presently understood. With the development of this SELDI-TOF-MS based assay for screening GSK-3&#x003b2; kinase activity, future studies can be directed at elucidating the role of this protein kinase in a variety of disease states in hopes of characterizing their molecular pathways.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Synthetic peptide substrates</title><p>Peptides used in this study (AnaSpec Incorporated, San Jose, CA) were;</p><p>&#x02022; Biotin-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ala-Glu-Glu-Leu-Asp-<bold>Ser-Arg-Ala-Gly-Ser<sup>PO4</sup></bold>-Pro-Gln-Leu-OH (2B-Sp, molecular weight 2063.2 Da.)</p><p>&#x02022; Biotin-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ala-Glu-Glu-LeulAsp-<bold>Ser-Arg-Ala-Gly-Ser</bold>-Pro-Gln-Leu-OH</p><p>(2B-S, molecular weight 1983.2 Da.)</p><p>&#x02022; Biotin-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ala-Glu-Glu-Leu-Asp-<bold>Ser-Arg-Ala-Gly-Ala</bold>-Pro-Gln-Leu-OH</p><p>(2B-A, molecular weight 1967.2 Da.)</p><p>Peptide substrates were diluted with HPLC grade water to working dilutions and stored at -80&#x000b0;C for later use in subsequent kinase assays.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>NIH 3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) with 10% Bovine calf serum and fresh 2 mM glutamine (Invitrogen Canada Inc.
