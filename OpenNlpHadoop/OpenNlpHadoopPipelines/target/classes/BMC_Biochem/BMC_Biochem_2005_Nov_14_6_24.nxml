Using this platform, the controlled expression of <sup>15</sup>N/<sup>13</sup>C labelled proteins requires the analysis of incorporation paths and rates of isotope-labelled precursors present in the medium into amino acids. For this purpose, <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda </italic>cells were grown in a complex medium containing [U-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]glucose.

The isotopolog compositions of the ribonucleosides and of alanine indicate considerable recycling of carbohydrate intermediates in the reductive branch of the pentose phosphate pathway.

Advantageously, insect cells provide eukaryotic type chaperones, permit the expression of long open reading frames, and are not subject to the limitations caused by bacterial codon preferences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Stable isotope labelling is crucial for NMR structure analysis of proteins using multinuclear spectroscopic techniques. Moreover, differential isotope labelling can significantly enhance the scope of various other spectroscopic techniques such as EPR, infrared and Raman spectroscopy for the analysis of proteins. Differential <sup>15</sup>N labelling of proteins in Baculovirus-infected insect cells has been achieved <italic>via </italic><sup>15</sup>N-labelled amino acids present in the growth medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>This study was designed to explore in some detail the metabolic network of <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda </italic>cells under the specific growth conditions for <sup>15</sup>N/<sup>13</sup>C labelling. Our data demonstrate that cultured <italic>S. frugiperda </italic>cells grown on commercial culture media rely on exogenous supply rather than on intracellular synthesis of most proteinogenic amino acids, although central metabolic intermediates (i.e., pentose phosphate, oxaloacetate, pyruvate and acetyl-CoA) acquire label from the proffered [U-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]glucose and transamination activity was observed in the experiment with exogenous <sup>15</sup>N-phenylalanine.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In order to assess the utilization of glucose for the biosynthesis of amino acids and ribonucleotides, we cultured <italic>S. frugiperda </italic>cells in a complex culture medium supplemented with a mixture of [U-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]glucose and unlabelled glucose at a ratio of 1:99. The cells were harvested, and lipids were removed by solvent extraction. Cellular RNA was hydrolysed by alkali treatment, and the resulting ribonucleotides were isolated and dephosphorylated. The resulting nucleosides were further purified by HPLC. The residue obtained after alkali treatment consisted predominantly of protein and was hydrolyzed by hydrochloric acid. Amino acids were isolated chromatographically from the hydrolysate.</p><p><sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra were determined for all isolated metabolites. <sup>13</sup>C Abundances were determined by quantitative NMR spectroscopy (see Methods). <sup>13</sup>C Signals of isotopologs carrying two or more adjacent <sup>13</sup>C atoms were characterized by satellite signals arising by <sup>13</sup>C<sup>13</sup>C couplings. As an example, the <sup>13</sup>C signals of the ribose carbon atoms of cytidine showed satellites indicating coupling to one or two adjacent <sup>13</sup>C atoms (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). More specifically, the signals of carbon atoms 1', 2', 3' and 5' appeared as pseudotriplets where the central lines represent molecules with a single <sup>13</sup>C atom, whereas the satellites indicate molecules with blocks of two <sup>13</sup>C atoms. The signature of the ribose carbon atom 4' displayed a central line, a doublet and a double-doublet indicating the presence of three different <sup>13</sup>C-labelled isotopologs, namely [4'-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>1</sub>]-, [4', 5'-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>2</sub>]-, and [3', 4', 5'-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>3</sub>]cytidine, respectively.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><sup>13</sup>C NMR signals of cytidine from <italic>S. frugiperda </italic>cells grown with a 1:99 mixture of [U-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]glucose and unlabelled glucose added to SF-900 II medium. <sup>13</sup>C-Coupling patterns are indicated.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2091-6-24-1"/></fig><p>From the relative fractions of each respective satellite pair in the total <sup>13</sup>C NMR signals (% <sup>13</sup>C<sup>13</sup>C in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) the abundance (in mol%) of the different isotopologs in the ribose moiety of cytidine (<bold>1</bold>) was calculated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Notably, the abundance of multiply <sup>13</sup>C-substituted molecules can be determined independently from the signal pattern of two or more different carbon atoms.

The sugar units of these nucleosides are all derived from the cellular pentose phosphate pool and the close similarity of their labelling patterns as shown by the low standard deviations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) again document the precision of the experimental data.

The quantitative analysis revealed the presence of a [4,5-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>2</sub>]-isotopolog at a molar abundance of 0.1 mol% (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) which was significantly above the natural abundance level (0.01 mol%).

In contrast to the spectra of the amino acids mentioned above, the <sup>13</sup>C NMR signals of alanine (<bold>4</bold>) were characterized by intense satellite signals due to couplings between adjacent <sup>13</sup>C atoms.

The nodes in the central area of the intermediary metabolic network involving the reciprocal transformation of simple carbohydrates, carboxylic and dicarboxylic acids are typically connected by short links. Notably, the sizes and complexity of networks in different organisms can now be compared in some detail on the basis of whole genome sequence data of more than 100 species. The comprehensive quantitative description of such a network requires, in principle, the quantitative assessment of forward and backward reactions mediated by hundreds to thousands of enzymes under intracellular conditions; studies in cell extracts after disruption of cellular integrity can hardly serve as substitute. However, an <italic>in vivo </italic>approach can be performed with cells or organisms on the basis of perturbation/relaxation analysis of the isotopolog distribution in target metabolites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>This approach can be briefly summarized as follows. Naturally occurring organic matter is a highly complex mixture of isotopologs comprising all stable isotopes of hydrogen, carbon and nitrogen. The natural abundance of <sup>13</sup>C is about 1.1%. In the quasi-equilibrium mixture of natural organic material of low molecular weight, the isotopologs carrying more than one <sup>13</sup>C atom are of low abundance; as an example, the approximate natural abundances of some <sup>13</sup>C-isotopologs of ribose are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T4"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Approximate natural abundance of selected ribose isotopologs carrying <sup>13</sup>C.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left"><bold>Isotopolog</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>Abundance [mol%]</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">[1-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>1</sub>]</td><td align="left">1.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left">[2-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>1</sub>]</td><td align="left">1.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left">[3-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>1</sub>]</td><td align="left">1.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left">[1,2-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>2</sub>]</td><td align="left">0.012</td></tr><tr><td align="left">[4,5-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>2</sub>]</td><td align="left">0.012</td></tr><tr><td align="left">[1,2,3-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>3</sub>]</td><td align="left">0.00013</td></tr><tr><td align="left">[3,4,5-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>3</sub>]</td><td align="left">0.00013</td></tr><tr><td align="left">[U-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>]</td><td align="left">0.000000018</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>The introduction of a <sup>13</sup>C-labelled compound into any biological system constitutes a local perturbation of the quasi-equilibrium state of isotopolog distribution in the respective metabolic network. Such a perturbation can spread in the network by way of enzymatic interconversion. The comprehensive analysis of the network-wide metabolic relaxation processes resulting from such an initial perturbation requires, in principle, the analysis of isotopolog compositions at virtually every node of the network at various times after the onset of the perturbation. In metabolic networks of typical prokaryotes and eukaryotes comprising hundreds to thousands of nodes, this is a relatively tall order. However, the task can be simplified quite considerably in light of two considerations. (i) Since metabolic networks are highly crosslinked <italic>via </italic>enzyme-catalyzed reactions, it is sufficient to measure the isotopolog distribution at a relatively small number of nodes. The isotopolog composition at numerous adjacent nodes can then be estimated on the basis of certain well-known enzyme catalyzed reactions. (ii) Following a perturbation of the isotopolog equilibrium, the relaxation process is typically not conducive to a true equilibrium state, since anabolic processes lead to a quasisteady state; only catabolic processes are conducive to actual reequilibration.</p><p>In practical terms, primary metabolites such as amino acids and nucleic acid constituents are biosynthetically derived from pools of small molecules by anabolic reactions. These primary metabolites are assembled from simple carbohydrates, carboxylic and dicarboxylic acids which are present in low amounts and are at the same time subject to rapid turnover. On the other hand, the products of primary metabolism (amino acids, nucleic acid components) become embedded into polymers (proteins, nucleic acids) where their turnover rate is relatively low. Thus, they reflect the isotopolog distribution of the central intermediary pools (carbohydrates, carboxylic acids) at the time of their formation. Based on these considerations, the transient label distribution in the central metabolite pools can be easily gleaned from analysis of the monomeric building blocks of proteins and nucleic acids (for review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]).</p><p>The formation of pentose derviatives from [U-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]glucose by oxidative decarboxylation <italic>via </italic>the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway, if active to a significant extent, should have afforded [U-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>]ribose phosphate. The virtual absence of that species in the ribonucleosides analyzed indicates that other metabolic processes (i.e. glycolytic cycling prior to any oxidative decarboxylation of glucose) must have played a crucial role. The observed isotopolog pattern can be best explained by cooperation of the reductive branch of the pentose phosphate cycle with glycolysis and regeneration of glucose from triose pool intermediates. Passage through the reductive branch of the pentose phosphate pathway results in breaking of the bond between C-3 and C-4 of glucose. The same is true for glycolysis. Both pathways afford [U-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>3</sub>]glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate from carbon atoms 4 through 6 of the proffered [U-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]glucose. The utilization of that intermediate by transketolase affords a [3,4,5-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>3</sub>]pentulose. On the other hand, grafting of a [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>2</sub>]-fragment derived from [U-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]glucose to an unlabelled glyceraldehyde phosphate moiety affords [1,2-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>2</sub>]pentulose phosphate isotopologs (species <bold>6 </bold>in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Metabolic processes involved in pentose/pentulose formation from [U-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]glucose in a large excess of unlabelled glucose (A), <italic>via </italic>the pentose phosphate cycle and (B), <italic>via </italic>glycolytic cycling followed by the pentose phosphate cycle.

Oxidative decarboxylation of these species also affords [1,2-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>2</sub>]- and [3,4,5-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>3</sub>]pentose phosphates, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>).</p><p>The formation of minor amounts of [4,5-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>2</sub>]pentoses can be explained by the transfer of a [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>2</sub>]fragment from a [1,2-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>2</sub>]pentulose phosphate (species <bold>6</bold>) to unlabelled erythrose phosphate by the action of transketolase. The resulting [1,2-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>2</sub>]fructose phosphate (species <bold>7</bold>) can then be converted to [2,3-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>2</sub>]triose phosphate which affords [4,5-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>2</sub>]pentose phosphate by recycling in the pentose phosphate cycle (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). The labelling patterns of the carbohydrate moieties indicate that <sup>13</sup>C-label is transferred efficiently to the triose phosphate pool by the joint action of glycolysis and the pentose phosphate cycle.</p><p>On the basis of the pyruvate/alanine transamination reaction, the labelling pattern of alanine can be taken as a reference for the labelling pattern of pyruvate. The isotopolog composition of alanine (<bold>4</bold>) was in perfect agreement with the labelling pattern of the three carbon moiety comprising C-3, C-4 and C-5 in the ribose unit of ribonucleosides (cf. Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). As discussed above, the latter moiety is biosynthetically equivalent to the triose phosphate pool and, on this basis, the isotopolog compositions of triose phosphate and pyruvate are apparently identical. It can be concluded that pyruvate is predominantly or exclusively biosynthesized from the triose phosphate pool <italic>via </italic>phosphoenolpyruvate and that alternative routes leading to pyruvate (e.g., <italic>via </italic>decarboxylation of oxaloacetate) do not contribute significantly to the <italic>de novo </italic>pyruvate synthesis under the experimental settings.</p><p>The presence of [4,5-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>2</sub>]glutamate indicates its formation from [4,5-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>2</sub>]2-ketoglutarate (species <bold>8</bold>) which is assembled from oxaloacetate and [1,2-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>2</sub>]acetyl-CoA <italic>via </italic>the citrate cycle (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). Following the reactions of the citrate cycle, [4,5-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>2</sub>]2-ketoglutarate is converted into a mixture of [1,2-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>2</sub>]- and [3,4-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>2</sub>]oxaloacetate (species <bold>9</bold>) <italic>via </italic>the symmetric intermediates succinate and fumarate. Transamination of these oxaloacetate species yields the detected aspartate isotopologs. Reaction of [3,4-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>2</sub>]oxaloacetate with acetyl-CoA should have afforded [1,2-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>2</sub>]2-ketoglutarate <italic>via </italic>the citrate cycle. Notably, this species is not reflected in the labelling pattern of analyzed glutamate. One possible explanation for this finding is the existence of two compartmented oxaloacetate and/or 2-ketoglutarate pools (i) providing substrates for the citrate cycle and (ii) providing substrates for transamination. Further experiments are necessary to clarify this hypothesis.</p><p>By comparison with alanine, the label concentration in the acidic amino acids derived from citrate cycle intermediates is significantly lower. This could be due to the incorporation of exogenously supplied glutamate and aspartate into protein. This is not surprising since the culture medium used contained relatively large amounts of asparagine, aspartate, glutamate and glutamine.</p><p>The virtual absence of label in many amino acids, with the exception of alanine, glutamate and aspartate, indicates that the <italic>de novo </italic>synthesis under the experimental conditions was limited to those amino acids which can be obtained by single step transamination reactions from keto acids which are abundantly present in intermediary metabolism (pyruvate, oxaloacetate and ketoglutarate) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).

However, labelling with <sup>15</sup>N could be hampered by the relatively high transamination activity in the cells (cf. also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]). Hence, the carbon skeleton of specific [<sup>13</sup>C,<sup>15</sup>N]-labelled amino acids would be incorporated intact, but the nitrogen label would be subject to extensive dilution by nitrogen from other, non-labelled amino acids.

The resulting free induction decays were processed by zero filling and multiplication with a Gaussian window function (lb, -1; gb, 0.1). 3-(Trimethylsilyl)-1-propanesulfonate served as an external standard for <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C NMR measurements. <sup>15</sup>N Chemical shifts are reported relative to the <sup>15</sup>N NMR signal of N-5 of [U-<sup>15</sup>N<sub>4</sub>]6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine at 327.0 ppm. <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C NMR signal assignments were taken from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Assessment of isotopolog composition</title><p>The isotopolog compositions of nucleosides and amino acids were determined by quantitative NMR spectroscopy (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Relative <sup>13</sup>C abundances were obtained from signal intensities in one-dimensional <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra. Specifically, the signal integrals (I*) were determined for each <sup>13</sup>C NMR signal of the metabolite under study. Using the same experimental settings, the signal integrals (I<sub>ref</sub>) of the same compound at natural <sup>13</sup>C abundance were determined. The ratios of the signal integrals of each respective carbon atom (I*/I<sub>ref</sub>) were then calculated. Absolute <sup>13</sup>C abundances were determined for certain carbon positions from the <sup>13</sup>C coupling satellites in the <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra (for an example, see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Relative <sup>13</sup>C abundances (I*/I<sub>ref</sub>) were then referenced to the absolute enrichments.</p><p>In NMR spectra of multiply labelled samples displaying <sup>13</sup>C<sup>13</sup>C coupling (for an example, cf. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), each satellite signal in the <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra was integrated separately. The relative fraction of each respective satellite pair in the total <sup>13</sup>C NMR signal integral of a given carbon atom was calculated (% <sup>13</sup>C<sup>13</sup>C in Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). The relative fractions of satellite pairs were then referenced to the overall <sup>13</sup>C abundance of a respective carbon atom which was determined as described above. This resulted in molar contributions (mol%) for each respective isotopolog.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>PA isolated the metabolites, MG grew the cells, HO and WE were responsible for the NMR analysis, WE and AB drafted the manuscript.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by grants from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, the Fonds der Chemischen Industrie and the Hans Fischer Gesellschaft.
