The specific sequence environment recognized by prenyltransferases consists either of the CaaX box for farnesyltransferase (FTase) and geranylgeranyltransferase 1 (GGTase1) or C-terminal cysteines of Rab GTPases in the case of geranylgeranyltransferase 2 (GGTase2). In all instances, the cysteine-containing region must be preceded on the N-terminal side by approximately 10 residues providing a generally polar, flexible, so called linker segment without inherent conformational preferences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The anchor can be of farnesyl (3 isoprenyl units) or of geranylgeranyl (4 isoprenyl units) type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Targeting to cellular membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and mediation of protein-protein interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] are well documented biological functions associated with these lipid anchors.</p><p>Members of the Ras family of GTPases are of particular medical interest, as their mutational hyperactivation as well as mutations of proteins lying upstream in their signaling pathways are associated with various cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Several other CaaX proteins from the Rho family of GTPases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and Rap1A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] are involved in tumorigenesis as well. Since their lipid modifications are essential for their biological function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], inhibitors of prenyltransferases (PTases), especially of FTase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] attracted the interest of pharmaceutical research as anti-cancer drugs. Two such compounds made it to phase III trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Furthermore, there is evidence that inhibitors of prenylation may be useful in the treatment of other diseases such as infestation with protozoa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>However, we are far from understanding the physiological consequences of inhibiting FTase or GGTase1 in cells since the lists of the respective substrates are essentially not known. Only a few dozen proteins, including several fungal lipopeptide pheromons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] (e.g. a-mating factor of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]) as well as mammalian proteins of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], the trimeric G proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and the nuclear lamins of type A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] and B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], have been experimentally identified and verified as substrates of specific prenyltransferases yet. Given the critical role of the prenyl anchor for biological function (both with respect to the occurrence of prenylation and to the dependence on anchor type), it is of growing interest to analyze the prenylation status of so far uninvestigated proteins and to enlarge the list of proven prenylated proteins. A recently developed sophisticated <italic>in silico </italic>method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] generates a high number of predicted protein candidates for prenylation and, especially for twilight zone predictions, efficient methods for experimental verification of prenylation are necessary.</p><p>The standard literature method for <italic>in vitro </italic>or <italic>in vivo </italic>analysis of selected candidates involves transcription/translation of a cloned construct and protein prenylation in the presence of <sup>3</sup>H-labeled lipid anchor precursors followed by autoradiography/fluorography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Necessary controls involve mutations of the C-terminal cysteine expected to be modified, prenyltransferase inhibitor applications and/or exposition to precursors of alternative prenyl anchors during the prenylation reaction. However, the reportedly long exposure times (weeks/months) contradict the need for several repetitions of the experiment. Optimization of protein expression and incubation conditions is typically not avoidable. In our own experience, many attempts with the standard technology ended up without reportable result; i.e., the signals in initial experiments were often below the detection limit. Scientific literature research showed that rarely a lab has studied the prenylation status of more than a single target, apparently as a consequence of the tenacious methodology.</p><p>The problem of long exposure times for <sup>3</sup>H-autoradiography has prompted us to study a variety of chromatographic and scintillation methods for developing a faster and more sensitive test system. We found a solution using a TLC linear analyzer for testing the prenylation of selected protein targets. N-terminally GST-tagged proteins were <italic>in vitro </italic>transcribed/translated and incubated with <sup>3</sup>H-labeled anchor precursors. Such a quick <italic>in vitro </italic>screen might also be useful for finding proteins that deserve the effort for detailed <italic>in vivo </italic>studies. A similar approach can be used <italic>in vivo</italic>, if HA-tagged target proteins are expressed in cell culture supplemented by radioactive prenyl anchor precursors. This new approach on the detection of weak <sup>3</sup>H-signals is expected also to be helpful for monitoring posttranslational modifications with similar <sup>3</sup>H-labeled anchors such as myristoyl or palmitoyl.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Optimization of experimental parameters and analysis of the prenylation behaviour of the protein Rap2A</title><p>The proposed new procedure starts with a PCR-amplification of the GST-Rap2A open reading frame (Genbank accession of Rap2A <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="BC070031">BC070031</ext-link>) followed by <italic>in vitro </italic>transcription and translation using rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of a <sup>3</sup>H-labeled isoprenoid donor. The GST-tagged target protein is purified utilizing glutathione sepharose 4B beads and concentrated by precipitation with acetone. The sample is subjected to SDS-page gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by electroblotting. Detection of incorporated radioactive label is performed by scanning with the TLC analyzer (scanning time: 20 minutes per lane). Afterwards, the amount of target protein is evaluated by Western blotting with an anti-GST-antibody on the same membrane.</p><p>Experiments with wildtype GST-Rap2A fusion protein and [<sup>3</sup>H]mevalonic acid were performed using various reaction times and amounts of radioactive label. The optimal conditions we found were 20&#x02013;40 &#x003bc;Ci [<sup>3</sup>H]mevalonic acid and at least four hours reaction time, which is in agreement with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].</p><p>Experiments with 20 &#x003bc;Ci [<sup>3</sup>H]mevalonic acid, 10 &#x003bc;Ci [<sup>3</sup>H]farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP) and 10 &#x003bc;Ci [<sup>3</sup>H]geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP) allowed affirmation of prenylation of Rap2A and identification of the preferred isoprenoid attached to Rap2A as a farnesyl-group. However, geranylgeranylation did also occur under the given conditions, but with much lower efficiency (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The respective peak area for FPP incorporation is about 15 times the one for GGPP integration. The mutated version (C180A) was used as a negative control reaction to rule out unspecific attachment and to confirm the location of the modification.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold><italic>Western blots and TLC scanning results for Rap2A with radioactive prenyl anchor precursors</italic></bold>.

It should be noted that the time consumption of the scanning procedure (1&#x02013;2 hour per gel) is markedly reduced compared with autoradiography (weeks-months). To allow direct comparison of methods, a film has been exposed with the same Western membrane used for detection with the TLC-Scanner after application of En<sup>3</sup>Hance Spray from PerkinElmer for one and for three weeks at -80&#x000b0;C. An exposure of three weeks was necessary to get a distinct signal from all bands, which had given a strong signal with the scanner. However, it wasn't sufficient to detect the low amount of GGPP incorporated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). If the expression of the target protein is lower than that of Rap2A, the autoradiography can require months of exposure time.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold><italic>Autoradiographs of Rap2A after exposure to radioactive prenyl anchor precursors</italic></bold>.

There is no sign of incorporation of GGPP as detected with the TLC-scanner, underscoring the higher sensitivity of our new method. It should be noted that it is difficult to evenly spread the En<sup>3</sup>Hance-substance over all membrane area. Therefore, it is not surprising that the relative signal intensities are not identical between TLC scanning and autoradiography.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2091-7-6-2"/></fig><p>To determine the enzyme prenylating Rap2A, we performed the same assay with and without inhibitors of prenyltransferases. The signal yielded by incorporation of [<sup>3</sup>H]FPP was reduced to background level upon addition of 50 &#x003bc;M of the FTase inhibitor FTI-277. In addition, the already weak signal of [<sup>3</sup>H]GGPP-incorporation was diminished to background level by FTI, while application of a GGTase inhibitor (GGTI-298) left a small peak (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). These data suggest that Rap2A is recognized only by FTase, but the enzyme can also transfer a geranylgeranyl-group, albeit with drastically reduced efficiency (1&#x02013;2 orders of magnitude) as suggested before on the basis of peptide substrate exposure to FTase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold><italic>Western blots and TLC scanning results for Rap2A incubated with prenyltransferase inhibitors</italic></bold>.

There is no incorporation of FPP with FTI (lane 2), and there is also no incorporation of GGPP with FTI (lane 4), while a hardly detectable signal remains with GGTI (lane 5), suggesting that Rap2A is recognized only by farnesyltransferase. However, the enzyme shows some cross-reactivity with GGPP.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2091-7-6-3"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Analysis of the in vitro prenylation of RasD2, v-Ki-Ras2 and RhoA63L with the TLC scanning method</title><p>These three candidates have been selected to show the ability of our new technique to detect alternative prenylation modes. RasD2 (synonym: Rhes, BC013419) is suggested to be a farnesylation target but only due to indirect evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Whereas K-Ras homologues such as v-Ki-Ras2 (the Q61H oncogene mutant of K-Ras4B, BC013572) are thought to be modified both by FTase and GGTase1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>], the RhoA protein (NM_001664.2) is primarily a GGTase1 target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>].</p><p>The same <italic>in vitro </italic>assay was performed on all three targets. Because of lower translation efficiency, the reaction mix had to be upscaled by a factor of 5 for RasD2 and RhoA63L and a factor of 7 for K-Ras4B compared with the recipe used for Rap2A. For RasD2 and RhoA63L, we used 50 &#x003bc;Ci of [<sup>3</sup>H]mevalonic acid and 25 &#x003bc;Ci of [<sup>3</sup>H]FPP/[<sup>3</sup>H]GGPP. In the case of v-Ki-Ras2, we applied 60 and 30 &#x003bc;Ci respectively. The results for RasD2 were similar to Rap2A with significant incorporation of a product of mevalonic acid as well as FPP, while GGPP yielded only a ca. 40 times weaker signal (as measured via area below peaks, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Thus, we have shown with direct arguments that RasD2 is indeed a target for farnesylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold><italic>Western blots and TLC scanning results for RasD2 with radioactive prenyl anchor precursors</italic></bold>.

These results provide strong evidence for the hypothesis of alternative prenylation while inhibiting FTase. RhoA yielded strong signals for the reactions with mevalonic acid and GGPP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). The efficiency of FPP attachment is lower than that with GGPP by a factor of 2. Since the amount of protein detected in the Western blot under condition of FPP addition (lane 3) is considerably larger than in the case of exposition to GGPP (lane 4), we suggest that GGPP is indeed the preferred substrate. This is in accordance with the literature that RhoA is geranylgeranylated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>] and K-Ras can be modified by both isoprenoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold><italic>Western blots and TLC scanning results for v-Ki-Ras2 (K-Ras-4B) with radioactive prenyl anchor precursors</italic></bold>.

A GFP-fusion protein of RhoA63L, which has been shown to be a primary geranylgeranylation target and which has been previously used for localization studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>], was used to demonstrate the functionality of the GGTI treatment. Membrane localization is observed for wildtype protein without and with FTI, nuclear mislocalization is found for the mutant and wildtype protein with GGTI.

As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> (part 9), fluorescence microscopy clearly revealed that the fusion protein was co-localized with cellular membranes. A GFP fusion construct harboring a Cys to Ala mutation within the CaaX box predominantly accumulated in the nucleus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, part 10). When using specific inhibitors of farnesylation (FTI-277) or of geranylgeranylation (GGTI-298), we surprisingly found that v-Ki-Ras2 was present mainly in the nucleus with FTI-277 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, part 11), whereas GGTI-298 did not show any affect on the localization of the fusion protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, part 12).</p><p>In the literature, K-Ras4A and K-Ras4B have been reported to be predominantly farnesylated <italic>in vivo</italic>. In the presence of potent FTIs, both proteins were alternatively prenylated by geranylgeranyltransferase-1 in the human colon carcinoma cell line DLD-1 and COS cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Respectively, K-Ras4A and K-Ras4B were found to be associated with the membrane fraction independent of the kind of prenylation in COS cells. For complete inhibition of K-Ras4B prenylation, a combination for FTI-277 and GGTI-298 was required as examined in five different human carcinoma cell lines from pancreatic, pulmonary, and bladder origins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. The differing results can be due to differences in cell lines, Ras substrates or GFP-v-Ki-Ras2 overexpression. In the latter case, the ratio of prenylpyrophosphate to substrate protein is skewed. Indeed, at high expression levels, GFP-v-Ki-Ras2 was always found predominantly in the nucleus, independent of the presence of FTIs, GGTIs or the Cys-to-Ala mutation within the C-terminal CaaX box. In support of our interpretation, Rilling <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>] reported that protein prenylation in Chinese hamster ovary cells can vary as a function of the extracellular mevalonate concentration. Fortunately, only for v-Ki-Ras2, we found the localization studies to be technically tricky, fragile and the results difficult to reproduce. Whereas cells were sensitive for overexpression of wildtype GFP-v-Ki-Ras2 resulting in low transfection efficiency and, consequently, the number of transfected cells was low, no similar difficulties could be observed for GFP-vi-K-Ras2 mutant C185A or any of the other GFP-fusion constructs of RasD2, Rap2A or RhoA.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of the in vivo prenylation of Rap2A with the TLC scanning method</title><p>It would be desirable to test whether the TLC scanning method is applicable also for the investigation of protein targets exposed to metabolic labelling with radioactive precursors <italic>in vivo </italic>and purified with immunoprecipitation from cell culture, SDS-page gel electrophoresis and Western transfer. Since we expected the translation efficiency to be critical for the success of the experiment, we selected Rap2A as test target (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). Indeed, it was possible to clearly show incorporation of radioactive FPP into Rap2A overexpressed in HeLa cells and recovered by immunoprecipitation with anti-HA-antibodies (lane 1) and the absence of the anchor in the C180A mutant treated identically (lane 2). It is especially notable that the amount of purified protein can be evaluated with an anti-HA-antibody on the same Western blot that was used previously for TLC-scanning similarly to the <italic>in vitro </italic>protocol with the anti-GST-antibody.</p><fig position="float" id="F9"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p><bold><italic>Western blots and TLC scanning results for Rap2A with radioactive FPP in vivo</italic></bold>.

In one of these variants, we utilized coupled <italic>in vitro </italic>transcription/translation and prenylation. But labelling with <sup>3</sup>H-marked isoprenoids was replaced by usage of [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine during translation, while the added isoprenoid was not radioactively marked. Purification via GST-beads was performed in analogy to the method described above but, after precipitation with acetone, the protein was resuspended in a denaturation buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 as well as 4 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 8 M urea. After denaturation, the solution was diluted by addition of 10 volumes 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>. Following digestion with trypsin, the peptides were separated using a C18 column in reverse phase HPLC. Radioactivity was detected by scintillation counting of the collected fractions after the UV signal was recorded. Since the C-terminal peptide of Rap2A contains a methionine residue, a radioactive signal should be found at a retention time characteristic for farnesylated peptides, while it should be absent for the C180A mutant, because the non-prenylated peptide would elute much earlier. Although the expected behavior was observed in singular experiments, we have not been able to select experimental conditions for the reproducible detection of prenylated peptides (see discussion).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The critical step in classical prenylation assays is the detection of the radioactive anchor with autoradiography/fluorography. Unfortunately, the sensitivity of this approach is weak since the <sup>3</sup>H-labeled anchors emit low-energy radiation and the amount of purified protein with attached anchor is typically very low before expression and modification conditions have been optimized individually for the specific target. The necessary exposure time is <italic>a priori </italic>unknown and varies widely depending on the target even after optimization of experimental conditions. Several experimenters reported long exposure times of up to several weeks (7 &#x02013; 30 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], 3 &#x02013; 14 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], at least one week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]). To confirm the efficiency of our protocol, we did a comparison of our detection method to a Western membrane treated with Perkin Elmer "En<sup>3</sup>Hance-spray", which is the membrane equivalent to a gel soaked in "Amplify" scintillation liquid, and found weak signals after one week and distinct signals only after three weeks (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, compared to Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). TLC scanning is an efficient alternative to autoradiography/fluorography.</p><p>Even having a negative outcome after 2 months exposure does not clarify whether the protein investigated cannot be prenylated or whether the amount of protein after purification is simply too low, for example due to unspecific adsorption to test tubes promoted by the prenyl anchor. It should be noted that the issue is not resolved with a [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine-based control of translation in a parallel experiment. However, this problem is circumvented by another advantage of the present protocol. It has the possibility to evaluate the amount of protein directly from the Western blot that has been used for TLC scanning. If a band is detected with low intensity of anti-GST- or anti-HA-antibody binding, this indicates that the expression of the target protein must be up-scaled.</p><p>Filter binding assays (i.e., the separation of proteins transcribed and translated <italic>in vitro </italic>in the presence of radioactive anchor precursors from free anchors with filters) provide another quick alternative to autoradiography. The information from such a test is limited since there is no size resolution of the protein mixture and no possibility to directly evaluate the amount of target protein. Furthermore, free radioactive anchors will non-specifically adsorb to the filter material or proteins resulting in high background signals.</p><p>To our knowledge, the current method is the first one utilizing a TLC-Scanner for the analysis of putative targets of PTases on Western blot membranes. Compared to autoradiography/fluorography, this approach reduces the detection time from several weeks/months to 20 minutes per lane, resulting in an overall time effort for the whole experiment of about three days, given that the cDNA of the GST- (or HA-tag-) fusion protein is already available. Additionally, this assay detects incorporated <sup>3</sup>H-label and translation efficiency of the same reaction, rendering control reactions with [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine redundant and reducing variability of results caused by pipetting inaccuracies. In conclusion, the TLC scanning method is more sensitive and offers a more reliable way of quantification of any covalently linked <sup>3</sup>H-labeled posttranslational modifications in much less time compared with autoradiography. Especially, when conditions for <italic>in vitro </italic>or <italic>in vivo </italic>protein expression and incubation still need to be set up or optimized, this method dramatically enhances chances of generating successfully generating reproducible results in reasonable time since the experimental cycle is considerably shortened.</p><p>The use of a GST-tag (or a HA-tag) provides a way of removing free radioactive label as well as separation from highly abundant proteins from the rabbit reticulocyte (<italic>in vitro </italic>test) or cell culture lysate (<italic>in vivo </italic>test), resulting in lower background signal. In addition for proteins with lower translation efficiency than Rap2A, it offers the opportunity to use bigger reaction volumes or larger cell cultures and load the whole yield on a gel without exceeding its capacity. Furthermore, it provides the opportunity to use the same primers and antibodies for all investigated proteins, making the adaptation of the assay to screening with higher throughput only a small step.</p><p>We have shown that the results obtained with our TLC scanning method are in line with those from parallel experiments testing electrophoretic mobility shifts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>) or subcellular localization changes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>) due to prenyl anchor attachment. It should be emphasized that the latter two methods are indirect and leave room for alternative interpretations whereas our assays based on TLC scanning provide a much stronger argument. It unequivocally shows anchor incorporation into the target protein directly <italic>in vitro </italic>as well as <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Unfortunately, we were not able to find any conditions, which reproducibly allowed detection of the prenylated peptide with HPLC-based purification methods after proteolytic digest. Most of the times, there was no visible difference between wildtype and mutant Rap2A in UV-signals as well as radioactivity measurements, except the fact that the total peptide content was significantly (ca. 3 times) higher for the mutant protein. These findings suggest that, in contrast to the non-prenylated protein, a considerable amount of prenylated protein is lost by unspecific adsorption to the walls of the Eppendorf tubes, vials, tubes and microwell plates used for the reaction and following processing steps. This is in agreement with our observation from the Western blots of the TLC scanning method (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>), which in almost all cases showed much higher protein content for the non-prenylatable mutant proteins. Additionally, we derived much better results when performing reaction and purification steps the same day, storing the samples in SDS-PAGE sample buffer at -20&#x000b0;C over night. Storage of the protein in the reaction mix or in PBS without detergent resulted in decreased radioactive signals. From these observations, we suggest that there would be even higher losses of the prenylated peptide after digestion, since the properties of the shorter polypeptide are much more dominated by the hydrophobic isoprenoid group, leaving only undetectable amounts of labeled prenylated peptide in solution.</p><p>These problems show that the chromatographic method might not be applicable for the small amounts of protein yielded by <italic>in vitro </italic>transcription/translation. There might be the possibility to overcome most of the troubles by simply increasing the amount of target protein. Results obtained with Rap2A expressed in HeLa-cells, purified by immunoprecipitation and digested with trypsin showed significant discrepancy between the UV-signals of wildtype and mutant protein (data not shown). One peak with a retention time close to the one of FPP had a peak area ~10 times larger for wildtype protein, while all other peaks were nearly identical. Based upon these promising preliminary experiments, future work may find a mass spectrometry-coupled HPLC-based approach useful for <italic>in vivo </italic>prenylation analysis.</p><p>We think that the mechanistic role of the prenyl anchor for the biological function of the proteins studied in this work still requires additional research. For the convenience of the reader, we summarize the current state of knowledge with respect to the molecular and cellular functions of the investigated protein targets for prenylation in the following four paragraphs. Apparently, Rap2A, RasD2, K-Ras and RhoA need the prenyl anchor to get translocated into the right signaling context by membrane association. Rap2 has been shown to promote integrin activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>] and to directly bind to the actin cytoskeleton of platelets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. Rap2A is regulated by the same GEFs and GAPs as Rap1, but with much lower efficiency for the GAPs. This results in a high ratio of GTP-bound protein. Rap2 may be a slow molecular switch with functions similar to Rap1, but while the latter transduces strong, transient signals, Rap2A could determine the basal level. Thus, Rap1 would be required in the initial step of cell adhesion, which is then maintained by Rap2 signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>].</p><p>RasD2/Rhes (<underline>r</underline>as <underline>h</underline>omolog <underline>e</underline>xpressed in <underline>s</underline>triatum) is expressed predominately in the striatum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>] but also in thyroid glands and pancreas &#x003b2;-cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. It is involved in selected stritial functions, mainly locomotor activity and motor coordination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. Unlike the Ras proteins, RasD2 does not activate the ERK-pathway, but it binds and activates phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). Additionally, RasD2 impairs activation of cAMP/PKA pathway by thyroid stimulating hormone (THS), as well as by activated &#x003b2;2-adrenergic receptor, suggesting a regulating function upstream of activation of the respective heterotrimeric G-protein complex. The mechanism of action implies uncoupling of the receptor from its downstream target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>].</p><p>The Ras proteins have been reported to be involved in many signaling pathways, regulation cell differentiation and proliferation as well as cell shape and motility, to mention only the most important. Ras proteins are GTPases that function as molecular switches, being active in GTP-bound state and inactive when GDP-bound. The different Ras proteins show high homology to each other and collaborate in a complex network, making it hard to distinguish whether their functions are provided by all of them or are unique for a certain type of Ras protein. Nevertheless, there is some experimental data indicating specific functions of K-Ras4B in cell-cell and cell-matrix contacts as well as in apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. These presumptions are supported by the fact that K-Ras4B has a different strategy for membrane association than H-Ras, N-Ras and K-Ras4A, with a polylysine stretch in the hypervariable region instead of cysteine residues as palmitoylation sites. This comes along with localization of K-Ras4B to different microenvironments of membranes and also a trafficking pathway different from the other Ras proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>].</p><p>In humans, there are three highly homologous isoforms of Rho GTPases, called RhoA, B and C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]. Similar to the Ras proteins, their activities are highly overlapping, explaining why reported functions are hardly ever assigned to a certain family member. Regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, particularly the formation of stress fibers, was the first reported function of Rho. Further investigations have revealed roles in the regulation of cell polarity, gene transcription, G1 cell cycle progression, microtubule dynamics and vesicular transport pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. Thus, it seems that Rho proteins play a major role in vital cell functions such as morphogenesis, chemotaxis, axonal guidance and cell cycle progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Savings in time for experimentation and the higher sensitivity for detecting <sup>3</sup>H-labeled lipid anchors recommend the TLC-scanning method with GST-tagged or HA-tagged target proteins as the method of choice for analyzing their prenylation capabilities <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>and, possibly, also for studying the myristoyl and palmitoyl posttranslational modifications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Construct production and cloning</title><p>We generated plasmids containing GST- and pEGFP-fusions of all genes studied in this work.

The Stratagene QuikChange XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit was used to introduce cysteine-to-alanine mutations in the CaaX-motifs.
