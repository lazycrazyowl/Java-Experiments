Yet the transporters that mediate the flux of these molecules into and out of the mitochondrion remain largely unknown. Previous studies in yeast have led to the molecular identification of a component of the major mitochondrial electrophoretic Mg<sup>2+ </sup>uptake system in this organism as well as a functional mammalian homolog. Other yeast mitochondrial studies have led to the characterization of an equilibrative fatty acid-stimulated Ca<sup>2+ </sup>transport activity. To gain a deeper understanding of the regulation of mitochondrial divalent cation levels we further characterized the efflux of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>and Mg<sup>2+ </sup>from yeast mitochondria.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>When isolated mitochondria from the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>were suspended in a salt-based suspension medium, Ca<sup>2+ </sup>and Mg<sup>2+ </sup>were released from the matrix space. Release did not spontaneously occur in a non-ionic mannitol media. When energized mitochondria were suspended in a mannitol medium in the presence of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>they were able to accumulate Ca<sup>2+ </sup>by the addition of the electrogenic Ca<sup>2+ </sup>ionophore ETH-129. However, in a KCl or choline Cl medium under the same conditions, they were unable to retain the Ca<sup>2+ </sup>that was taken up due to the activation of the Ca<sup>2+ </sup>efflux pathway, although a substantial membrane potential driving Ca<sup>2+ </sup>uptake was maintained. This Ca<sup>2+ </sup>efflux was independent of fatty acids, which have previously been shown to activate Ca<sup>2+ </sup>transport. Endogenous mitochondrial Mg<sup>2+ </sup>was also released when mitochondria were suspended in an ionic medium, but was retained in mitochondria upon fatty acid addition. When suspended in a mannitol medium, metal chelators released mitochondrial Mg<sup>2+</sup>, supporting the existence of an external divalent cation-binding site regulating release. Matrix space Mg<sup>2+ </sup>was also slowly released from mitochondria by the addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, respiratory substrates, increasing pH, or the nucleotides ATP, ADP, GTP, and ATP-gamma-S.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In isolated yeast mitochondria Ca<sup>2+ </sup>and Mg<sup>2+ </sup>release was activated by increased ionic strength. Free nucleotides, metal ion chelators, and increased pH also stimulated release. In yeast cells this release is likely an important mechanism in the regulation of mitochondrial matrix space divalent cation concentrations.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Mg<sup>2+ </sup>is the most abundant divalent cation in cells and is important for many metabolic processes. Free Mg<sup>2+ </sup>in cells is quite low (0.3 &#x02013; 3%) as compared to the total amount of Mg<sup>2+ </sup>due to buffering by polyphosphates, nucleic acids, and free nucleotides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In mammalian cells the free concentration is usually maintained at a concentration between 0.25 and 1 mM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The Mg<sup>2+ </sup>level in the cell varies during changing physiological conditions. The free Mg<sup>2+ </sup>level increases slightly as ATP levels decrease. The total cellular Mg<sup>2+ </sup>level changes upon the addition of several hormones to cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Recently the TRPM family of ion channels has been found to play an important role in cellular Mg<sup>2+ </sup>homeostasis in several tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. This suggests that regulated pathways for Mg<sup>2+ </sup>transport exist to maintain proper intracellular levels.</p><sec><title>Mammalian mitochondrial Mg<sup>2+ </sup>transport</title><p>The pathways involved in mammalian mitochondrial Mg<sup>2+ </sup>flux are largely unknown. The human homolog of a component of the main electrophoretic mitochondrial Mg<sup>2+ </sup>transporter in yeast has been cloned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The protein can functionally substitute for its yeast homolog. These double membrane-spanning proteins likely homo-oligomerize to form ion-transporting complexes. However definitive evidence that this protein functions in mammalian mitochondrial ion transport has yet to be obtained.</p><p>Heart mitochondria take up and release Mg<sup>2+ </sup>in a respiration-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Uncouplers of respiration that dissipate the membrane potential release mitochondrial Mg<sup>2+ </sup>into the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. There is evidence that hormones alter mitochondrial Mg<sup>2+ </sup>levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Hormones may increase cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels to stimulate Mg<sup>2+ </sup>transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Fatty acids have been shown to stimulate the efflux of mitochondrial Mg<sup>2+ </sup>at alkaline pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Even though mitochondrial Mg<sup>2+ </sup>has been well characterized at the isolated organelle level, the cellular signals regulating mitochondrial Mg<sup>2+ </sup>transport have not been clearly elucidated.</p></sec><sec><title>Mg<sup>2+ </sup>transport in yeast</title><p>In yeast cells when medium Mg<sup>2+ </sup>is plentiful (&#x0003e; 1 mM), yeast cells contain around 400 nmole Mg<sup>2+</sup>/mg protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. As medium Mg<sup>2+ </sup>decreased (0.02 mM), cellular Mg<sup>2+ </sup>decreased to levels near 80 nmole/mg protein. In times of ample Mg<sup>2+</sup>, the Mg<sup>2+ </sup>is taken up and stored in the vacuole. When these cells were then placed in a Mg<sup>2+ </sup>free growth medium, they survived by utilizing their vacuole stores. But once the cellular Mg<sup>2+ </sup>level became too low, the yeast cells died, in contrast to limitations in many other nutrients in which the cells survive in the G<sub>0 </sub>phase of the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>Two genes comprising the yeast Mg<sup>2+ </sup>uptake system in the plasma membrane have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Yeast plasma membrane Mg<sup>2+ </sup>transport is inhibited by aluminum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and polyamines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Since overexpression of either of the Mg<sup>2+ </sup>transport proteins confers resistance to aluminum toxicity, the inhibition of Mg<sup>2+ </sup>uptake may be the primary cause for aluminum toxicity in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Mg<sup>2+ </sup>may also provide benefits to cells confronted with heavy metals. Increased cellular Mg<sup>2+ </sup>levels protected cells from toxic concentrations of Mn<sup>2+ </sup>by down-regulating Mn<sup>2+ </sup>transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Yeast mitochondrial Mg<sup>2+</sup></title><p>Mg<sup>2+ </sup>is essential for many mitochondrial reactions including those of DNA and RNA metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] as well as ATP synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Mg<sup>2+ </sup>blocks the yeast mitochondrial ATP-induced unspecific channel (YMUC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Mg<sup>2+ </sup>also inhibits mitochondrial anion uniport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Therefore, the regulation of matrix space Mg<sup>2+ </sup>could be important for the mitochondrial distribution of many other ions. In this report we discovered that Mg<sup>2+ </sup>and Ca<sup>2+ </sup>are released from yeast mitochondria under conditions of increased ionic strength. In yeast cells this release pathway is likely an important regulator of mitochondrial divalent cation levels.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Ionic media prevent ETH-129-mediated accumulation of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup></title><p>In contrast to mammalian mitochondria, energized yeast mitochondria do not elecrophoretically take up Ca<sup>2+ </sup>or undergo an increase in non-specific inner membrane permeability in the presence of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. However energized yeast mitochondria open an unspecific channel (YMUC), which dissipates the membrane potential in the absence of the YMUC inhibitors phosphate or decavanadate. Yeast mitochondria can accumulate Ca<sup>2+ </sup>by the addition of the electrogenic Ca<sup>2+ </sup>ionophore ETH-129 to intact cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] or to energized mitochondria in a mannitol medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. When suspended in a 0.3 M KCl medium, energized mitochondria were unable to accumulate Ca<sup>2+ </sup>after ETH-129 addition as measured by mitochondrial-targeted aequorin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] or the presence of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-indicating dye antipyrylazo III (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Less Ca<sup>2+ </sup>was accumulated as the KCl concentration increased. Increasing the KCl concentration to 0.3 M only allowed less than 30 percent of the medium Ca<sup>2+ </sup>to be accumulated. It is important to note that ETH-129 has no transport affinity for K<sup>+ </sup>and the presence of KCl does not affect the binding of ETH-129 to Ca<sup>2+ </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. After all of the medium Ca<sup>2+ </sup>was taken up by mitochondria suspended in a mannitol medium, the addition of 0.3 M KCl caused the slow efflux of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>from the matrix space. This efflux of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>did not occur when an equal amount of sorbitol was added. Similarly to mitochondria suspended in KCl media, mitochondria suspended in increasing concentrations of choline Cl media osmotically balanced with mannitol were increasingly unable to accumulate high levels of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>by the addition of ETH-129 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>ETH-129 mediated mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+ </sup>uptake is greatly reduced in an ionic medium</bold>. <italic>panel A</italic>, the medium contained a 0.6 osmolar (osM) mixture of 0.3 M KCl and 0.6 M mannitol, 10 mM HEPES (TEA<sup>+</sup>), pH 7.20, 10 mM KP<sub>i</sub>, 0.5 mg/ml BSA, 10 &#x003bc;M EGTA (K<sup>+</sup>), and 0.1 mM antipyrylazo III.

Therefore no non-specific pore opened to allow Ca<sup>2+ </sup>efflux or KCl influx. If a non-specific pore were to open, an influx of KCl into the matrix space would result in an increase in matrix space volume and a decrease in light scattering of the mitochondrial suspension. Further evidence for the lack of mitochondrial pore opening is that a substantial membrane potential (&#x00394;&#x003a8;) was maintained in a KCl medium after ethanol, Ca<sup>2+ </sup>and ETH-129 addition (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). The &#x00394;&#x003a8; was monitored by the absorbance of the dye safranine O [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Ca<sup>2+ </sup>and ETH-129 don't cause swelling or a large &#x00394;&#x003a8; drop when mitochondria are suspended in KCl</bold>. <italic>panel A</italic>, the medium contained 0.3 M KCl, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.20, 10 mM KP<sub>i</sub>, and 0.5 mg/ml BSA. 1 mM ethanol, 80 &#x003bc;M CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 3.6 &#x003bc;M ETH-129 were present as shown. <italic>panel B</italic>, the medium contained a 0.6 osM mixture of 0.3 M KCl and 0.6 M mannitol, 10 mM HEPES (TEA<sup>+</sup>), pH 7.20, 10 mM KP<sub>i</sub>, 0.5 mg/ml BSA, and 12 &#x003bc;M safranine O. 1 mM ethanol, 80 &#x003bc;M CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 3.6 &#x003bc;M ETH-129, and 4 &#x003bc;M FCCP were added where indicated. 1 mM ethanol was chosen because this concentration prevents mitochondrial swelling in a 0.3 M KCl medium.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2091-7-4-2"/></fig><p>In the KCl medium in the absence of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>and ETH-129, the &#x00394;&#x003a8; was roughly twenty percent smaller than that observed when the mitochondria were suspended in a mannitol medium. Immediately following Ca<sup>2+ </sup>and ETH-129 addition the &#x00394;&#x003a8; in the mannitol medium dropped to a lower value than that observed after the same treatment in the KCl medium. At the same time Ca<sup>2+ </sup>was taken up more rapidly in the mannitol medium. Therefore a sufficient driving force for mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+ </sup>uptake by ETH-129 was maintained in the KCl medium although the Ca<sup>2+ </sup>was not retained in the organelle. The steady state &#x00394;&#x003a8; attained in the 0.3 M KCl media after Ca<sup>2+ </sup>and ETH-129 addition was approximately two-thirds of the value of that in the mannitol medium. These results are consistent with the activation of a Ca<sup>2+</sup>/H<sup>+ </sup>exchange when mitochondria are suspended in the ionic media. This activity together with the electrogenic ETH-129-mediated Ca<sup>2+ </sup>uptake causes proton re-entry into the matrix space to slightly decrease the &#x00394;&#x003a8;. After the &#x00394;&#x003a8; reached a steady state, it was completely dissipated by addition of the uncoupler FCCP (carbonyl cyanidep-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone) to give the baseline level.</p><p>In a previous report a large decrease in the &#x00394;&#x003a8; occured after ETH-129 addition to mitochondria suspended in a mannitol medium in the absence of BSA (bovine serum albumin) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Together with ionophore-catalyzed Ca<sup>2+ </sup>influx, activation of a fatty acid stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup>/H<sup>+ </sup>exchange led to the decreased &#x00394;&#x003a8;. Because the &#x00394;&#x003a8; was not dissipated to as great of an extent when mitochondria were suspended in a KCl medium, the Ca<sup>2+ </sup>efflux pathway described here appears to be less active than the one activated by fatty acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Increasing ionic strength induces release of Mg<sup>2+ </sup>from mitochondria</title><p>Using atomic absorption spectrophotometry, we determined that isolated yeast mitochondria contain between 25 and 35 nmole Mg<sup>2+</sup>/mg protein. This is fairly consistent with a previously measured value of between 20 and 30 nmole Mg<sup>2+</sup>/mg protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. When non-energized mitochondria were suspended in a 0.3 M KCl medium, endogenous Mg<sup>2+ </sup>was lost from the matrix space in a time-dependent manner (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). A slightly higher rate of Mg<sup>2+ </sup>efflux also occurred in the presence of ethanol, ETH-129 and Ca<sup>2+ </sup>under identical conditions to Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> (data not shown). To study the effects of varied ionic strength on the Mg<sup>2+ </sup>efflux rate, non-energized mitochondria were suspended in 0.6 osmolar (osM) media containing a varied KCl concentration osmotically balanced with mannitol (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref><italic>inset</italic>.) Increasing the KCl concentration increased the rate of Mg<sup>2+ </sup>release from the matrix space. When no KCl was present virtually all of the Mg<sup>2+ </sup>remained in the mitochondria.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>An ionic medium induces a loss of mitochondrial Mg<sup>2+</sup></bold>. The medium contained 0.3 M KCl, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.20, and 0.1 mM decavanadate (Na<sup>+</sup>).

Endogenous Mg<sup>2+ </sup>was released from the matrix space at slightly different rates in the different ionic media in increasing order TMA Cl &#x0003c; choline Cl &#x0003c; KCl &#x0003c; Tris Cl (compare K<sup>+ </sup>in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> to choline in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). These rates of Mg<sup>2+ </sup>release corresponded to the rates of spontaneous swelling of yeast mitochondria in these salt media. However, Mg<sup>2+ </sup>was released even faster than any of these spontaneous rates in a KCl medium in the presence of 1 mM ethanol (data not shown) where no swelling occurred (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Mg<sup>2+ </sup>was also released at a substantial rate in K<sup>+ </sup>TES media where no swelling occurred. Therefore organelle lysis due to matrix space swelling was not responsible for the Mg<sup>2+ </sup>release. The entry of ions into the matrix space may help displace bound Mg<sup>2+ </sup>to stimulate the rate of efflux.</p><p>When non-energized yeast mitochondria were suspended in a choline Cl medium, the addition of either EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) or ADP slightly increased the Mg<sup>2+ </sup>efflux rate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). The combined presence of EDTA and ADP increased the rate of Mg<sup>2+ </sup>efflux more than either compound alone. The addition of ethanol as a respiratory substrate also increased the efflux of Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Since ethanol opens the yeast mitochondrial unselective channel (YMUC), decavanadate, a YMUC inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], was present in the medium during all experiments. Since the efflux of Mg<sup>2+ </sup>is fairly rapid even in the absence of ADP, EDTA, or ethanol, the addition of these compounds only slightly stimulated the rate of efflux.</p></sec><sec><title>EDTA, respiration, ADP, and ATP stimulate loss of Mg<sup>2+ </sup>from mitochondria</title><p>To verify the effects of the addition of EDTA, ethanol, and ADP observed in a choline Cl medium, similar experiments were performed suspending mitochondria in a mannitol medium where only a very small rate of spontaneous Mg<sup>2+ </sup>release occured. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, adding 2 mM ethanol only led to the release of 20&#x02013;25 percent of the endogenous matrix space Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Adding 2 mM EDTA resulted in a quick initial and then subsequently slower release of Mg<sup>2+</sup>. The addition of EDTA and ethanol together led to a very quick release of almost all of the endogenous mitochondrial Mg<sup>2+</sup>. The addition of ATP caused a slightly greater rate of Mg<sup>2+ </sup>release than ADP. The presence of carboxyatractyloside, an inhibitor of the adenine nucleotide translocator, did not alter the rate of Mg<sup>2+ </sup>efflux when ATP or ADP was added. Therefore ADP and ATP likely bind to a site on the outer surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane to release Mg<sup>2+</sup>. ADP and ATP were half maximally effective at concentrations of 0.43 mM and 0.22 mM respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>ADP, ATP, ethanol, and EDTA stimulate mitochondrial Mg<sup>2+ </sup>efflux in a mannitol medium</bold>. <italic>panel A</italic>, the medium contained 0.6 M mannitol, 10 mM HEPES (TEA<sup>+</sup>), pH 7.20 and 0.1 mM decavanadate (Na<sup>+</sup>).

EDTA and EGTA are metal ion chelators. These results suggest that an inhibitory metal ion blocks the Mg<sup>2+ </sup>release pathway at a site on the inner membrane facing the cytoplasm. EDTA likely binds the inhibitory metal ion to stimulate efflux. GTP and ATP-&#x003b3;S were nearly as effective as ATP in activating the Mg<sup>2+ </sup>efflux pathway. The nucleotide analog 5'-fluorosufonylbenzoyladenosine (FSBA) partially blocked the ADP-induced Mg<sup>2+ </sup>release suggesting that nucleotides do not activate release solely by chelating an inhibitory metal ion. The addition of 0.1 mM Ca<sup>2+ </sup>also led to a slight increase in the Mg<sup>2+ </sup>release rate. Unlike yeast plasma membrane Mg<sup>2+ </sup>transporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], Al<sup>3+ </sup>did not block mitochondrial Mg<sup>2+ </sup>efflux (data not shown).

Assuming that this nonspecific divalent cation influx activity also equilibrates free matrix space and external Mg<sup>2+ </sup>concentrations, the free matrix space Mg<sup>2+ </sup>concentration would be approximately 1.2 mM for our isolated mitochondria that contained 31.5 nmol Mg<sup>2+</sup>/mg protein.

Mg<sup>2+ </sup>also regulates the yeast mitochondrial ATP synthase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The free concentration of Mg<sup>2+ </sup>in beef heart mitochondria is estimated to be between 0.7 and 0.9 mM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Within the physiological range, Mg<sup>2+ </sup>can modulate the efficiency of the mammalian 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and mitochondrial ATP synthase to affect the rate of oxidative phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Therefore the matrix space Mg<sup>2+ </sup>level needs to be maintained within a specific range to maintain proper mitochondrial function. However in other species and tissues mitochondrial Mg<sup>2+ </sup>has been shown to vary over a larger range from 0.2 to 1.5 mM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>The role of EDTA and EGTA in stimulating Mg<sup>2+ </sup>efflux</title><p>EDTA and EGTA have very different affinities for activating mitochondrial Mg<sup>2+ </sup>release. The most likely candidate for a metal ion bound by EDTA and EGTA to activate Mg<sup>2+ </sup>release is Mg<sup>2+ </sup>itself because it has a greatly different affinity for each of these chelators. Many other divalent cations such as Ca<sup>2+ </sup>do not satisfy this criterion. The ability of EDTA to activate mitochondrial Mg<sup>2+ </sup>efflux from the cytoplasmic side of the inner membrane suggests that when the cytoplasmic concentration of the inhibiting ion is low, mitochondrial Mg<sup>2+ </sup>equilibrates with the cytoplasmic concentration. However, the significance of mitochondrial Mg<sup>2+ </sup>efflux functioning to supply Mg<sup>2+ </sup>to the cytoplasm is questionable, since the vacuole is the major storage organelle for Mg<sup>2+ </sup>in yeast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>The presence of a cytoplasmically facing Mg<sup>2+ </sup>inhibiting the mitochondrial efflux of divalent cations does not appear to be entirely consistent with a mitochondrial influx of Mg<sup>2+ </sup>(see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Binding of Mg<sup>2+ </sup>to the external inhibitory site may be expected to inhibit Mg<sup>2+ </sup>influx into the matrix space. However, a salt-based medium may displace inhibitory Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Yeast mitochondria do not swell when suspended in a 0.3 M Mg<sup>2+ </sup>acetate medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] indicating that an influx of Mg<sup>2+ </sup>into the matrix space does not occur at this very high concentration. Therefore mitochondrial influx may depend on the specific KCl and Mg<sup>2+ </sup>concentrations employed. In a previous report Mg<sup>2+ </sup>was transported into yeast mitochondria in the absence of a membrane potential, however at a highly reduced rate compared to energized mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison to yeast mitochondrial cation transporters</title><p>Fatty acids and BSA do not regulate the mitochondrial Mg<sup>2+ </sup>and Ca<sup>2+ </sup>release studied in this report as they did the yeast mitochondrial fatty acid-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup>/H<sup>+ </sup>exchanger described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Since yeast mitochondria <italic>in situ </italic>are exposed to an environment containing KCl and do not appear to have a high activity Ca<sup>2+ </sup>efflux pathway open [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], perhaps some regulatory element inhibiting mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+ </sup>release is lost during mitochondrial isolation or upon suspension of isolated mitochondria in ionic media.</p><p>The yeast mitochondrial Mg<sup>2+ </sup>release activity may be of a similar nature as the yeast mitochondrial K<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+ </sup>exchange. The similar inhibitors and conditions stimulating mammalian mitochondrial K<sup>+ </sup>and Mg<sup>2+ </sup>transport have been noted previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The activities of both yeast proteins are non-specific in nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] (and see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Cations also stimulate both activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] (and see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Further experiments are needed to determine if divalent cations can exchange for many other cations across the inner mitochondrial membrane or just for protons. Both yeast mitochondrial Mg<sup>2+ </sup>release and K<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+ </sup>exchange appear to be inhibited by divalent cations. The yeast K<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+ </sup>exchange, although only moderately inhibited by Mg<sup>2+</sup>, is strongly inhibited by Zn<sup>2+ </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], whereas the ability of chelators to activate Mg<sup>2+ </sup>release suggests a role for divalent cations in regulating this activity as well. However there is at least one striking difference in the regulation of yeast mitochondrial Mg<sup>2+ </sup>release and K<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+ </sup>exchange. The K<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+ </sup>exchange appears to be spontaneously active in isolated yeast mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] when they are suspended in a mannitol medium as monitored by the efflux of endogenous K<sup>+ </sup>(data not shown) while Mg<sup>2+ </sup>release does not occur spontaneously in a mannitol medium.</p><p>In a previous study no loss of free mitochondrial Mg<sup>2+ </sup>was detected in yeast mitochondria when they were suspended in a 0.135 M KCl medium for thirty minutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], while we detect a loss of over 70 percent of the total mitochondrial Mg<sup>2+ </sup>levels in just ten minutes in 0.3 M KCl media using mitochondria from strain W303-1A. However, in the previous study the DBY747 yeast strain was used and the mitochondria were preloaded in a 10 mM Mg<sup>2+ </sup>135 mM KCl medium before Mg<sup>2+ </sup>release was monitored.
