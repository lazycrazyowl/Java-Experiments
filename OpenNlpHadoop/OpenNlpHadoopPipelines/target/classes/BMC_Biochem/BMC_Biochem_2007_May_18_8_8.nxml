This reduces the effective amount of drug available for therapeutic efficacy. Co-administration of allopurinol, a suicide inhibitor of XOD, which blocks the hydroxylation of 6MP inadvertently enhances the 6MP blood level, counters this reduction. However, allopurinol also blocks the hydroxylation of hypoxanthine, xanthine (released from dead cancer cells) leading to their accumulation in the body causing biochemical complications such as xanthine nephropathy. This necessitates the use of a preferential XOD inhibitor that selectively inhibits 6MP transformation, but leaves xanthine metabolism unaffected.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Here, we have characterized two such unique inhibitors namely, 2-amino-6-hydroxy-8-mercaptopurine (AHMP) and 2-amino-6-purinethiol (APT) on the basis of IC<sub>50 </sub>values, residual activity in bi-substrate simulative reaction and the kinetic parameters like <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>, <italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub>, <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>. The IC<sub>50 </sub>values of AHMP for xanthine and 6MP as substrate are 17.71 &#x000b1; 0.29 &#x003bc;M and 0.54 &#x000b1; 0.01 &#x003bc;M, respectively and the IC<sub>50 </sub>values of APT for xanthine and 6MP as substrates are 16.38 &#x000b1; 0.21 &#x003bc;M and 2.57 &#x000b1; 0.08 &#x003bc;M, respectively. The <italic>K</italic><sub>i </sub>values of XOD using AHMP as inhibitor with xanthine and 6MP as substrate are 5.78 &#x000b1; 0.48 &#x003bc;M and 0.96 &#x000b1; 0.01 &#x003bc;M, respectively. The <italic>K</italic>i values of XOD using APT as inhibitor with xanthine and 6MP as substrate are 6.61 &#x000b1; 0.28 &#x003bc;M and 1.30 &#x000b1; 0.09 &#x003bc;M. The corresponding <italic>K</italic><sub>m </sub>values of XOD using xanthine and 6MP as substrate are 2.65 &#x000b1; 0.02 &#x003bc;M and 6.01 &#x000b1; 0.03 &#x003bc;M, respectively. The results suggest that the efficiency of substrate binding to XOD and its subsequent catalytic hydroxylation is much superior for xanthine in comparison to 6MP. In addition, the efficiency of the inhibitor binding to XOD is much more superior when 6MP is the substrate instead of xanthine. We further undertook the toxicological evaluation of these inhibitors in a single dose acute toxicity study in mice and our preliminary experimental results suggested that the inhibitors were equally non-toxic in the tested doses.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We conclude that administration of either APT or AHMP along with the major anti-leukemic drug 6MP might serve as a good combination cancer chemotherapy regimen.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>6MP, an analog of hypoxanthine was first among the thiopurine series found to be useful as an anticancer drug to treat ALL, the most common malignancy affecting children and other leukemias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. 6MP is taken up by the cell and is transformed into an active metabolite 6-thio-inosine monophosphate, an inhibitor of DNA synthesis, by the target enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) using phosphoribosyl-pyrophosphate (PRPP) as a co-substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. 6MP is also inadvertently being utilized by another enzyme XOD leading to the generation of an inactive metabolite, 6TUA which is excreted in urine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Levels of XOD expression varies from tissue to tissue and is also known to be over-expressed in tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. So, in such cases, when the anticancer drug 6MP is administered, it would possibly lead to more metabolic transformation of 6MP. XOD catalyzes a two-step hydroxylation reaction of 6MP, leading to formation of 8-OH-6MP first and subsequently to 6TUA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Scheme showing oxidative hydroxylation of 6-mercaptopurine to 6-thioxanthine to 6-thiouric acid.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2091-8-8-1"/></fig><p>The wasteful degradation of 6MP by XOD suggested that it is highly essential to minimize this catabolic pathway by the use of a XOD inhibitor. Previous reports indicated that semicarbazide could inhibit XOD and XDH activities <italic>in vitro </italic>as well as <italic>in vivo </italic>but the inhibition <italic>in vivo </italic>was less than 50% at doses that produced significant toxic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Then, allopurinol, a pyrazolopyrimidine derivative and an analog of hypoxanthine, was employed as a part of combination cancer therapy along with 6MP and was found to result in a noticeable drop in the pace of catabolism of 6-substituted purines including 6MP as well as potentiate the antitumor and immunosuppressive properties of 6MP upto three to four-folds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Allopurinol is a non-specific suicide inhibitor of XOD available in market for the treatment of gout, caused by the accumulation of uric acid crystals in the joints and tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. XOD is an important purine metabolism pathway enzyme which catalyzes the oxidative hydroxylation of the natural purine, hypoxanthine to xanthine to finally uric acid which is excreted in the urine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Allopurinol usage in the combination chemotherapy with 6MP increases plasma concentration of the anticancer drug allowing the reduction in the large 6MP dose to almost 25% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. On the other hand, allopurinol displays certain biochemical complications; the most important amongst these is leading to the accumulation of natural purines hypoxanthine and xanthine, as along with 6MP, allopurinol also inhibits the natural hydroxylation pathway of hypoxanthine and xanthine to uric acid. This accumulation of natural purines leads to xanthine nephropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Furthermore, a huge amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is generated with the administration of allopurinol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Scheme showing oxidative hydroxylation of hypoxanthine to xanthine to uric acid.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2091-8-8-2"/></fig><p>So, alternatively a substrate specific inhibitor along with administration of this multipotential drug, 6MP must be used. Diphenyleneiodonium chloride has been reported as the preferential inhibitor of NAD(P)H oxidase as it inhibits the NADH oxidation more effectively than of NADPH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Human PC4 is also been reported as a substrate specific inhibitor of the RNA Polymerase II phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Inspite of the humungous progress towards the development of XOD inhibitors to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], there has been no report of any such substrate specific inhibitor that selectively prevents 6MP from being wastefully transformed into 6TUA against natural purines. In the present work, we have discussed the action of two such preferential XOD inhibitors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A preferential XOD inhibitor is the one which will inhibit 6MP from being metabolized by the action of XOD while enzymatic hydroxylation of xanthine to uric acid is continued. The hydroxylation reaction of hypoxanthine forming uric acid and 6MP forming 6TUA has no common intermediates (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><sec><title>IC<sub>50 </sub>determination</title><p>A few purine and pyrazolo pyrimidine-based compounds were screened for inhibitory property against XOD-catalyzed hydroxylation using xanthine and 6MP as substrates (data not shown). 10 &#x003bc;M of either of the substrates and 2.8 U/ml of XOD were taken for the IC<sub>50 </sub>determination (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). IC<sub>50 </sub>values of allopurinol for the enzymatic conversion of xanthine to uric acid and 6MP to 6TUA are found to be almost same (2.36 &#x000b1; 0.03 and 1.92 &#x000b1; 0.03 &#x003bc;M) and therefore, suggest that allopurinol is equally efficient in inhibiting enzymatic conversion of both xanthine to uric acid and 6MP to 6TUA formation. Since allopurinol is a suicide inhibitor of XOD and the inhibition develops time-dependently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], so the IC<sub>50 </sub>value of allopurinol was calculated for the late phase as well by carrying out the reaction for 60 min and the IC<sub>50 </sub>values of allopurinol for XOD corresponding to the substrates hypoxanthine and xanthine were 0.55 &#x000b1; 0.45 and 1.65 &#x000b1; 0.25 &#x003bc;M, respectively. While for 6MP, the IC<sub>50 </sub>values were already calculated from 60 min reaction. Among many compounds tested, two purine-based compounds namely, AHMP and APT demonstrated a lower IC<sub>50 </sub>value for the 6MP to 6TUA reaction (0.54 &#x000b1; 0.01 &#x003bc;M and 2.57 &#x000b1; 0.08 &#x003bc;M, respectively), although showed a reasonably higher IC<sub>50 </sub>value for the xanthine to uric acid formation reaction (17.71 &#x000b1; 0.29 &#x003bc;M and 16.38 &#x000b1; 0.21 &#x003bc;M, respectively). The lower IC<sub>50 </sub>values for 6MP hydroxylation than xanthine indicate that AHMP and APT inhibit hydroxylation of 6MP and xanthine with variable efficiencies. These two purine-based compounds are found to be showing no such difference in the IC<sub>50 </sub>value in the first and the late phases and none were found to be XOD substrates. However, like allopurinol, the recently discovered XOD inhibitors, 6-(N-benzoylamino)purine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and also 4-aminopyrazolo 3, 4-d pyrimidine (APP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] did not exhibit any preferential inhibition of the 6MP hydroxylation over xanthine. The results imply that the structure of the inhibitor plays a major role in regulating this preferential inhibition mechanism.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Table showing IC<sub>50 </sub>values of different purine and allopurinol-based compounds for XOD inhibition.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td></td><td></td><td align="center" colspan="3"><bold>(&#x003bc;M &#x000b1; SEM)</bold></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td colspan="3"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><bold>Inhibitor</bold></td><td></td><td align="center"><bold>Hypoxanthine</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Xanthine</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>6MP</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">ALLOPURINOL</td><td align="center"><inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="1471-2091-8-8-i1.gif"/></inline-formula></td><td align="center">0.91 &#x000b1; 0.01</td><td align="center">2.36 &#x000b1; 0.03</td><td align="center">1.92 &#x000b1; 0.03</td></tr><tr><td align="center">APT</td><td align="center"><inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="1471-2091-8-8-i2.gif"/></inline-formula></td><td align="center">7.28 &#x000b1; 0.17</td><td align="center">16.38 &#x000b1; 0.21</td><td align="center">2.57 &#x000b1; 0.08</td></tr><tr><td align="center">AHMP</td><td align="center"><inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="1471-2091-8-8-i3.gif"/></inline-formula></td><td align="center">5.08 &#x000b1; 0.04</td><td align="center">17.71 &#x000b1; 0.29</td><td align="center">0.54 &#x000b1; 0.01</td></tr><tr><td align="center">APP</td><td align="center"><inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="1471-2091-8-8-i4.gif"/></inline-formula></td><td align="center">6.79 &#x000b1; 0.28</td><td align="center">20.76 &#x000b1; 0.84</td><td align="center">12.86 &#x000b1; 0.69</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>The reaction mixture comprised of 1 ml of 0.2 M, sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 containing 10 &#x003bc;M of one of the substrates namely, hypoxanthine, xanthine or 6MP.

Mechanistically, this type of inhibition is interpreted as competitive. Structurally speaking, we observe that the 8<sup>th </sup>position in both xanthine and APT is free for hydroxylation facing the Mo site of XOD. Also, both APT and xanthine has substitution at the same positions, i.e. 2<sup>nd </sup>and 6<sup>th</sup>. Therefore, it seems that xanthine and APT compete for XOD active site. Consequently, it becomes evident that APT will bind to XOD at its substrate binding site. The <italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub><sup>1 </sup>value estimated from the LB plot using the equation (1) [mentioned in Methods section] were equivalent to 6.6 &#x000b1; 0.28 &#x003bc;M with respect to xanthine (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>).</p><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> projects a LB plot of steady-state inhibition of XOD using 6MP as substrate with increasing APT concentrations, suggesting a conventional competitive inhibition mechanism. Structural explanations illustrate that 8<sup>th </sup>position is open for action in both 6MP and APT in front of the Mo site of XOD. The <italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub><sup>1 </sup>value determined from the LB plot using the equation (1) [mentioned in Methods section] was found to be 1.30 &#x000b1; 0.09 &#x003bc;M (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>).</p><p>AHMP also showed signs of efficiently inhibiting the XOD-catalyzed 6MP catabolic reaction than the xanthine hydroxylation reaction. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> demonstrates the LB plot of the steady-state inhibition of XOD using xanthine as substrate with increasing AHMP concentrations, illustrating the mixed type of inhibition like known XOD inhibitors, BOF-4272, Pd<sup>+2</sup>, Y-700, Morin and Galagin, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The <italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub><sup>2 </sup>and <italic>K</italic><sub>I</sub><sup>2 </sup>values of 5.78 &#x000b1; 0.48 &#x003bc;M (competitive) and 6.24 &#x000b1; 0.04 &#x003bc;M (non-competitive) were calculated from the LB plot using the equation (4) and (5) [mentioned in Methods section]. Its non-competitive inhibition property can be explained on the basis that 8<sup>th </sup>position is occupied by SH group in AHMP, which is found free in xanthine. Besides, the presence of NH<sub>2 </sub>group at 2<sup>nd </sup>position in AHMP in place of an OH group in xanthine makes it faultless contender to bind at any site other than active site on XOD. And its competitive inhibition property may be due to the presence of OH group present at the 6<sup>th </sup>position in both AHMP and xanthine and thus, they compete for the enzyme active site.</p><p>For XOD-catalyzed 6MP catabolic reaction, AHMP shows evidence of a mixed inhibition mechanism (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>) indicating that native XOD is capable of forming two inhibitory complexes with AHMP. Occurrence of SH group at positions 6<sup>th </sup>in 6MP and at 8<sup>th </sup>in AHMP makes the latter an ideal applicant to compete with 6MP for active site and consequent inhibition of XOD. However, the existence of extra groups (OH and NH<sub>2</sub>) in AHMP at two positions makes it attach at a site other than the active site of the enzyme. <italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub><sup>2 </sup>and <italic>K</italic><sub>I</sub><sup>2 </sup>values for inhibition were calculated out to be 0.96 &#x000b1; 0.01 &#x003bc;M (competitive) and 0.98 &#x000b1; 0.06 &#x003bc;M (non-competitive) using the equations (4) and (5) [mentioned in Methods section]. The values of the two inhibition constants of AHMP do not differ much, indicating that the nature of the coordination of the AHMP for the competitive and non-competitive binding sites is similar.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison and evaluation of acute toxicity</title><p>Single dose acute toxicity was evaluated for AHMP and APT and compared with allopurinol, the standard drug used in the present investigation.

The weekly food intake decreased for the groups treated with AHMP, APT and allopurinol as compared to vehicle treated groups. However, AHMP and APT treated groups food intake was marginally less as compared to allopurinol treated groups. Gross necropsy revealed no changes in vital organs. No difference in organ weight was observed as compared with the control groups.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>Inhibition mechanism of Xanthine oxidase by AHMP and APT</title><p>Mixed-type inhibition includes competitive and non-competitive inhibition. Competitive inhibition is exhibited when the substrate and the inhibitor compete for the substrate binding active site but non-competitive inhibition is exhibited when the inhibitor binds at a site other than the active site. Following the crystallographic studies performed on XOD, no peripheral binding site has been reported in XOD catalytic subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. For the past 50 years, it was assumed that the two XOD subunits carry out catalysis independently but a recent report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] on the cooperative binding of the two subunits of XOD may support the non-competitive inhibition mechanism exhibited by AHMP. AHMP possibly interacts with the XOD domains distal to the substrate binding site also other than the substrate binding site, thereby possibly resulting in allosteric effects that attenuate the enzymatic activity.</p><p>Since XOD acts via a ping-pong mechanism, alternating between the oxidized and reduced forms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], so another plausible explanation for the mixed inhibition exhibited by AHMP is that AHMP binds to both the oxidized and reduced form of XOD. Allopurinol (a known weak competitive inhibitor) and nitric oxide are known to strongly bind to the reduced state of XOD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. APT being a competitive inhibitor thus, might not be binding to the oxidized state but to the reduced state of XOD. The difference in the mechanism of inhibition exhibited by AHMP and APT must be possible due to the structural dissimilarities between the two inhibitors.</p></sec><sec><title>Biochemical explanations of the efficiency of binding of substrate and inhibitor to Xanthine oxidase</title><p>The <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>, <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>and <italic>K</italic><sub>i </sub>values of XOD corresponding to the substrates, 6MP and xanthine and the inhibitors, APT and AHMP behave as the factors indicating the type of their binding and catalytic interactions with the enzyme.

Additionally, XOD-6MP (ES) complex is also less favored as the <italic>K</italic><sub>m </sub>in this case is high (6.01 &#x000b1; 0.03 &#x003bc;M). Considering xanthine as substrate of XOD however, the situation is different. The high <italic>k</italic><sub>cat </sub>(114.54 &#x000b1; 0.24 &#x003bc;M/min) indicates that the forward reaction of xanthine-XOD into uric acid (ES into E+P) is faster as compared to its dissociation into other counterpart (E+S) and lower <italic>K</italic><sub>m </sub>(2.65 &#x000b1; 0.02 &#x003bc;M) indicates that xanthine-XOD (ES) complex formation is also more favored. Therefore, the higher turnover of xanthine to uric acid conversion in comparison to 6MP to 6TUA conversion is favored only if the ES complex formation is favored rather than its dissociation into E+S which does not occur in case of 6MP-XOD interaction.</p><p>Now, we can presume a correlationship of <italic>K</italic><sub>m </sub>and <italic>K</italic><sub>i </sub>of XOD with respect to xanthine and 6MP, respectively. When 6MP and APT (or AHMP) interact with XOD, lower <italic>K</italic><sub>i </sub>implies stronger XOD-AHMP (EI) complex formation and AHMP will more efficiently dissociate 6MP from XOD active site while higher <italic>K</italic><sub>m </sub>implies less favored XOD-6MP (ES) complex formation and subsequently, slower 6TUA formation, further supporting that XOD and 6MP (E+S) formation is much preferred in 6MP as compared to xanthine. However, when xanthine and APT (or AHMP) interact with XOD, higher <italic>K</italic><sub>i </sub>implies weaker and slower rate of formation of XOD-AHMP (EI) complex and the inhibitor AHMP is not efficient in displacing xanthine from XOD and thus, the enzymatic hydroxylation of xanthine continues while lower <italic>K</italic><sub>m </sub>implies more favored formation of XOD-xanthine (ES) complex and subsequently, higher formation of uric acid.</p><p>It will be right to say that these preferential inhibitors, AHMP and APT displace 6MP efficiently from weak XOD-6MP complex while AHMP and APT are incapable of displacing xanthine from strong xanthine-XOD complex (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>). In other words, substrate hit and inhibitor displacement takes place from XOD active or non-active site for xanthine-XOD reaction but inhibitor hit and substrate displacement for 6MP-XOD reaction. It can be stated that the 6MP to 6TUA hydroxylation is discriminately inhibited in contrast to xanthine to uric acid hydroxylation by these preferentially inhibitors.</p><fig position="float" id="F10"><label>Figure 10</label><caption><p>6-mercaptopurine-XOD-Inhibitor interaction showing inhibitor hit and substrate displacement.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2091-8-8-10"/></fig><fig position="float" id="F11"><label>Figure 11</label><caption><p>Xanthine-XOD-Inhibitor interaction showing substrate hit and inhibitor displacement.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2091-8-8-11"/></fig></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In the present study, we have attempted to search a preferential XOD inhibitor which would discriminately inhibit the 6MP to 6TUA reaction rather than xanthine to uric acid reaction because allopurinol employed in combination with 6MP as cancer chemotherapy inhibits enzymatic hydroxylation of hypoxanthine, xanthine, and 6MP with equal efficiency, which leads to the development of some biochemical problems like xanthinuria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and xanthine nephropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Furthermore, hypoxanthine when accumulated in the body competes with 6MP for the action by HGPRT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Additionally, it has been observed that the administration of allopurinol, as a component of combination chemotherapy leads to the depletion in the intracellular pool of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) as allopurinol is converted to allopurinol ribonucleotide by HGPRT using PRPP. The allopurinol ribonucleotide possesses further the potential for inhibition of PRPP amidotransferase and orotidylic acid decarboxylase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Conversion to the allopurinol nucleoside by purine nucleoside phosphorylase has also been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>].</p><p>We found two such preferential inhibitors namely, APT and AHMP. The extent of inhibition is dependent on the binding interactions of the respective substrates and inhibitors with the enzyme.</p><p>It is important to mention here that APT is a known anticancer drug with HGPRT as its target enzyme. Therefore, use of APT as a preferential XOD inhibitor along with 6MP may increase the efficiency and reduce the dosage of 6MP. We conclude that administration of either APT or AHMP along with the major anti-leukemic drug 6MP might serve as a good combination cancer chemotherapy regimen. To the extent that adverse consequences of allopurinol therapy may relate to actions of this purine analog compound exclusive of XOD inhibition, the selectivity of AHMP and APT may lessen the risk for at least some of the untoward effects of current combined chemotherapy in patients with cancer. To the best of our knowledge, we have for the first time developed such preferential inhibitors of XOD based on the difference in the interactions with its substrate and inhibitor.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>AHMP and APT both were purchased from Lancaster, UK.
