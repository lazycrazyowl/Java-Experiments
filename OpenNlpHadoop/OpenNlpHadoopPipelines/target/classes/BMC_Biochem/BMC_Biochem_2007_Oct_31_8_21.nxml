Such activity led to the hypothesis that the enzyme participates in the final steps of precursor processing, namely of neuropeptide and hormone precursors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In most cases, proteolytic activation of peptide precursors occurs at arginine and lysine residues and involves the sequential action of an endoprotease and an exopeptidase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Research efforts had focused primarily on endopeptidases cleaving at the COOH-terminus of basic amino acid doublets and on the subsequent participation of a carboxypeptidase E or H (EC 3.4.17.10; reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]).</p><p>However, several endoproteases have been shown to produce cleavage of basic amino acid doublets on their NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal side [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Moreover, NH<sub>2</sub>-terminally extended form of various peptides, bearing an extra Arg or Lys residue resulting from proteolytic processing of their corresponding precursors, have been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Several recent studies have demonstrated that Ap-B activity occurs in combination with different proteases, such as NRD convertase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], Cathepsin L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and aminopeptidase A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Although clarification of the physiological relevance of Ap-B and identification of all of its <italic>in vivo </italic>substrates is not complete, some of these substrates were recently identified. Indeed, Ap-B processes glucagon into miniglucagon in the &#x003b1;-cells of the islets of Langerhans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and could also process angiotensin peptides in rat cardiac fibroblastic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and enkephalins in various tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The enzymatic properties of Ap-B and its expression pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] lead to the hypothesis that this enzyme could be involved in inflammatory processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], development of tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and Type II diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>The biochemical characterization of the purified enzyme isolated from rat testis yielded important information. Ap-B is a monomeric 72 kDa Zn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent exopeptidase, which selectively removes Arg or Lys residues from the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminus of several peptide substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In addition to its exopeptidase activity, Ap-B exhibits a residual capacity to hydrolyze leukotriene A<sub>4 </sub>(LTA<sub>4</sub>) into the pro-inflammatory lipid mediator leukotriene B<sub>4 </sub>(LTB<sub>4</sub>), <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The bi-functional nature of Ap-B is supported by a close phylogenetic relationship with LTA<sub>4 </sub>hydrolase (LTA<sub>4</sub>H; EC 3.3.2.6; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]), which hydrolyzes LTA<sub>4 </sub>into LTB<sub>4</sub>, <italic>in vivo</italic>, and exhibits an aminopeptidase activity, <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Both enzymes belong to the M1 family of metallopeptidases (consensus Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding site HEXXHX<sub>18</sub>E; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]).</p><p>The high-resolution crystal structure of LTA<sub>4</sub>H in complex with inhibitors (i.e. bestatin) was recently described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. This was the first 3D structure determined in the M1 family of metalloexopeptidases to which Ap-B also belongs. Various attempts to crystallize Ap-B have failed due to the low solubility of the enzyme. However, the phylogenetic relationship between LTA<sub>4</sub>H and Ap-B offered the opportunity to model the Ap-B structure using LTA<sub>4</sub>H as a template in order to acquire structural data which will be essential to understand the enzymatic mechanisms, the structure of potential physiological substrates and to design potent inhibitors of Ap-B.</p><p>In this paper, we describe the production and purification of the rat Ap-B (rAp-B) in <italic>E. coli</italic>, the characterization of the recombinant protein and its catalytic properties. Eighteen different mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis to confirm the functional roles of conserved amino acids belonging to the M1 consensus motif [<underline>H<sup>325</sup>E</underline>XX<underline>H</underline>X<sub>18</sub><underline>E</underline><sup>348</sup>], which constitutes the Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding site. As a step toward the determination of the Ap-B catalytic mechanisms and the structural requirements for the control of substrates specificity, a complete alignment of 500 sequences of the M1 family was performed to point out conserved residues and evolutionary divergences. A part of this alignment was used for the construction of a 3D model of the whole 650 amino acid-long rAp-B based on the crystal structure of human LTA<sub>4</sub>H [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] in complex with Zinc ion and bestatin.</p><p>The structural relevance of some previously <italic>in silico </italic>detected consensus sites, such as RNP1 binding motif and Armadillo domain involved in protein-protein interactions is also discussed. Lastly, structural surface differences between Ap-B and LTA<sub>4</sub>H were examined and the results lead to the hypothesis that Ap-B exhibits numerous protein-protein interaction properties according to its putative physiological functions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Expression and purification of the E. coli recombinant rat Ap-B protein</title><p>A 1965 bp-long DNA fragment containing the rat Ap-B CDS was cloned into the pIVEX2.4 expression vector (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1-A</xref>). Then, the recombinant rat Ap-B protein (rAp-B) was produced with this T7 promoter-driven plasmid in a BLi5 <italic>E. coli </italic>strain. The translated product comprises a histidine tag (His-tag) at the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminus followed by a factor Xa restriction protease cleavage site and the rAp-B sequence, providing a 673 amino acid protein (His-rAp-B; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1-A, -B</xref>). The difference in length due to the fused His-tag/Factor Xa site tail (673 versus 650 amino acid residues) leads to a slight difference of electrophoretic mobility, which is observed in Western blot analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1-B</xref>). This latter also shows that His-rAp-B is properly expressed in this prokaryotic expression system.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Cloning of rat Ap-B coding region, expression and purification of the <italic>E. coli </italic>recombinant rat Ap-B protein</bold>. <bold>(A) </bold>Schematic representation of the pIVEX2.4-Ap-B vector.

Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1-C</xref> shows that there is a significant loss of desired His-rAp-B during the first washing. Any attempts to increase the binding specificity of the histidine tag during this step led to a decrease of specificity during the elution steps. Gel electrophoresis of the elution fractions E1 and E2 (1.5 mL each) showed only one band with a relative molecular mass around 73 kDa (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1-C</xref>). Both fractions were pooled and concentrated to 1 mL in Tris-HCl 50 mM pH 7.2. The final concentration of the purified His-tag rAp-B was about 160 &#x003bc;g.mL<sup>-1</sup>. Consequently, an adequate quantity of enzyme is obtained with this purification procedure since we obtained 160 &#x003bc;g of purified protein from 50 mL of cell culture corresponding to a purification rate of 3.2 mg.L<sup>-1</sup>.</p><p>In order to identify potential differences in the kinetic parameters of the enzyme activity due to the purification procedures, the His-tagged rAp-B was also semi-purified using a DEAE Trisacryl Plus M ion exchange column eluted with 80 mM KCl (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1-D</xref>). Gel electrophoresis of the elution fractions containing Ap-B activity (5 mL each) showed several bands with a relative molecular mass between 35 to 115 kDa (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1-D</xref>). Fractions 43 to 47, which contain 4 main detectable bands on the silver stained SDS-PAGE were pooled (25 mL; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1-D</xref>) and concentrated to 5 mL in Tris-HCl 50 mM pH 7.2. The final concentration of the semi-purified proteins was ~40 &#x003bc;g.mL<sup>-1 </sup><italic>versus </italic>80 &#x003bc;g.mL<sup>-1 </sup>for fractions 48 to 53. Within the limits of a visual quantification, this analysis shows that the amounts of His-tagged rAp-B corresponds to about 30% of the total proteins leading to an estimated purification rate of about 1 mg.L<sup>-1</sup>.

Indeed, a decrease of activity due to the higher purification of the enzyme was previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Meanwhile, this purification step is required to calculate the kinetic constant such as kcat and consequently kcat/Km. Equivalent measurements using the DEAE semi-purified His-rAp-B show that enzyme activity is similar to that of Ni-NTA (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Consequently, the semi-purified enzyme can also be used in activity assays.

Note that the Uniprot database only contains the human Ap-O sequence (Q5T9B3, Q8WUL6, Q96M23). Although Ap-O is most closely related to Ap-B, the global identity between both enzymes is very low (23.5%; LTA<sub>4</sub>H <italic>versus </italic>Ap-O, about 20 %). Due to a large discrepancy in length (Ap-B, 650 amino acids; Ap-O, 819 amino acids) and weak percentages of identity and similarity (32.8%), the evolutionary relationships between these two proteins remains unclear.

The overall percentages of the different secondary structures differ (Ap-B: &#x003b1;-helix, 42%; &#x003b2;-sheet, 14%; loops, 44% <italic>versus </italic>LTA<sub>4</sub>H: &#x003b1;-helix, 46%; &#x003b2;-sheet, 23%; loops, 31%). In a model deleted from the first 30 NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal residues that are non homologous to LTA<sub>4</sub>H due to the difference in length between both proteins, these percentages can be estimated for Ap-B to: &#x003b1;-helix, 44%; &#x003b2;-sheet, 15%; loops, 41%. As shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, this difference in the percentage of &#x003b2;-sheet is mainly due to the presence of gaps in the alignment and to the weak similarity between both proteins in the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal region (residues 1&#x02013;133 in Ap-B sequence). Further refinement of the structure could probably slightly modify the loop/&#x003b2; relative percentage but the main features described below would be maintained.</p><p>The remaining part of the secondary structural alignment exhibits a high homology (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). A very small parallel two-stranded &#x003b2;-sheet of three amino acids (LTA<sub>4</sub>H, V<sup>307</sup>TN<sup>309 </sup>and K<sub>418</sub>SI<sup>420</sup>; Ap-B, V<sup>336</sup>TN<sup>338 </sup>and Q<sup>448</sup>SI<sup>450</sup>) and a &#x003b1;-helix lying just upstream this &#x003b2;-sheet (LTA<sub>4</sub>H, position 291&#x02013;300; Ap-B, position 320&#x02013;329) are conserved between LTA<sub>4</sub>H and Ap-B model (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). This helical structure carries the first part of the Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding motif(HEXXH). In both structures, a large &#x003b1;-helix (LTA<sub>4</sub>H, position 315&#x02013;334; Ap-B, position 344&#x02013;363), which contains the third Zn<sup>2+</sup>ligand (E<sup>319</sup>) is located between the two strands of this small &#x003b2;-sheet. This &#x003b1;-helix is followed by a loop (LTA<sub>4</sub>H, position 365&#x02013;374; Ap-B, position 394&#x02013;404) that forms and limits one side of the substrate binding pocket.</p><p>Then, in both proteins, another &#x003b1;-helix (LTA<sub>4</sub>H, position 382&#x02013;397; Ap-B, position 412&#x02013;428), perpendicular to the &#x003b1;-helix containing the HEXXH motif, carries the LTA<sub>4</sub>H Tyr<sup>384</sup>residue (Ap-B, Tyr<sup>414</sup>, 3.25 &#x000c5; from the Zn<sup>2+ </sup>ion in the Ap-B model; Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5-D</xref>) thought to be the proton donor in the catalytic reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Lastly, a fourth &#x003b1;-helix (LTA<sub>4</sub>H, position 401&#x02013;415; Ap-B, position 431&#x02013;445) takes the primary structure back to the first strand to form the second strand and the small &#x003b2;-sheet. It should be noted that the small parallel two-stranded &#x003b2;-sheet of three amino acids found in Ap-B and LTA<sub>4</sub>H is also conserved in F3 and ePepN structures (data not shown). This small &#x003b2;-sheet structure might be important because it seems to link and to maintain, without too much rigidity considering its size, two important secondary structures containing conserved residues implicated in catalysis and Zn<sup>2+ </sup>binding.</p><p>As described in the LTA<sub>4</sub>H structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], a SH3 like motif located in a loop (P-XX-P motif; position 449&#x02013;462) is also found in the Ap-B model (position 485&#x02013;499; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5-C</xref>, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). However, the Ap-B structural model also exhibits a second proline-rich loop in position 47&#x02013;57 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5-C</xref>, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).

RNP1 sequence is masked by this loop and a swinging of this latter structure could render the putative RNA-binding site accessible to its substrate (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5-C</xref>; Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). The Tyr<sup>413 </sup>residue (proton donor) also belongs to this &#x003b1;-helix. No RNP2 consensus sequence is found in the Ap-B primary structure.</p><p>In order to perform a more precise comparison between the Ap-B model and LTA<sub>4</sub>H, the electrostatic potentials of the molecular surfaces of both proteins were computed.

Four different orientations with their corresponding 3D ribbon structure are represented showing the 4 different sides of both proteins. The potential scale ranges from -7 kT/e to 7 kT/e (from red to blue). The electrostatic potential distribution between both enzymes is significantly different. rAp-B shows a higher negative potential (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, Orientation 1, 2 and 3), especially in the catalytic domain. Altogether, the &#x003b1;-helix and the &#x003b2;-sheet domains of Ap-B seem to exhibit a general negative and neutral/positive potentials, respectively. Conversely, the &#x003b1;-helix and the &#x003b2;-sheet domains of LTA<sub>4</sub>H exhibit a general neutral/positive and negative potentials, respectively.

The recombinant rAp-B was produced with a NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal histidine tag and was characterized. The results showed that the expressed protein exhibits the same biochemical properties as its rat counterpart, in terms of its immunoreactivity, kinetic parameters, substrate specificity, NaCl dependence and inhibitor sensitivity. Therefore, this recombinant enzyme was perfectly usable for enzymatic studies.</p><p>In order to confirm the functional role of the conserved HEXXHX<sub>18</sub>E motif previously studied in several other enzymes of the M1 family (For review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]), an investigation was conducted by site-directed mutagenesis. As expected, mutagenesis of any of the three zinc ligands of the <underline>H<sup>325</sup></underline>EXX<underline>H<sup>329</sup></underline>X<sub>18</sub><underline>E<sup>348</sup></underline> motif in rAp-B sequence or of the critical general base of the peptidase reaction E<sup>326 </sup>leads to a complete lack of aminopeptidase activity.</p><p>In parallel, multiple alignments for the M1 family of aminopeptidases were performed to study the conservation of the residues involved in the exopeptidase activity, these residues constituting eventual targets for further site-directed mutagenesis studies. Our results clearly demonstrate that 3 sub-groups or sub-families constitute the current M1 aminopeptidase family. The main difference between these sub-groups is the presence or the partial loss of a GXMEN motif upstream the Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding site. The first sub-family is restricted to <italic>Actinobacteria </italic>(loss of Gly, Met, Asn and conservation of Glu). A second sub-family (lack of Gly, Glu, Asn and conservation of Met) is composed of only one member expressed in Vertebrates (Ap-O; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]). Interestingly, numerous site-directed mutagenesis studies of the GXMEN motif among the M1 family(Aminopeptidase A, Ap-A, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]; Aminopeptidase N, Ap-N, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]; Thyrotropine Releasing Hormone Degrading Enzyme, TRH-DE, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]; LTA<sub>4</sub>H, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]) suggested that the glutamate and asparagine residues are implicated in the transition state stabilisation. Moreover, these residues, that might interact with the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminus of substrates, are also suspected to be responsible for the aminopeptidase specificity. The Gly residue (an exception is found for TRH-DE, Ala <italic>versus </italic>Gly) seemed crucial for the activity because its replacement with bigger or polar residues abolishes the activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Lastly, the mutation of the methionine affects both Km and Vm, but no precise role of this residue was proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Meanwhile, Ito and collaborators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] demonstrated that this Met residue is implicated in the recognition of different substrates, explaining the broad specificity of the enzyme. Data about the enzymatic activity of the proteins of the <italic>Actinobacteria </italic>sub-family are not yet available. Diaz-Perales and collaborators demonstrated <italic>in vitro </italic>that Ap-O is an aminopeptidase with specificity for Arg and Asn residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Further investigation on evolutionary relationships between these proteins and especially on their enzymatic characterization constitute a major goal to grasp the physiological role of these aminopeptidases implicated in fundamental processes of cell metabolism.</p><p>In order to investigate the catalytic mechanism of Ap-B, we used molecular modelling. In the present work, we generate a molecular model of the whole rat Ap-B structure based on the crystal structure of the human LTA<sub>4</sub>H [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The crystal structures of the Tricorn interacting factor F3 (F3; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]) and of the aminopeptidase N from <italic>E. coli </italic>(ePepN; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]), two other members of the M1 family that exhibit less than 25 % of identity with LTA<sub>4</sub>H and Ap-B, were considered to be not closely related to Ap-B. Moreover, 4 structural domains exist in F3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] and ePepN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Interestingly, this fourth domain is inserted just upstream the conserved amino acid region highlighted in the multiple alignment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, position 490). The Ap-B model is quite comparable to the LTA<sub>4</sub>H structure particularly at the level of their catalytic domains. Examination, in both structures, of the distances between Zn<sup>2+ </sup>ion and the chelating residues His<sup>325</sup>, His<sup>328 </sup>and Glu<sup>348</sup>, as well as the shape and size of the substrate-binding pocket shows a perfect homology.</p><p>The Ap-B structural model was also used to examine <italic>in silico </italic>predicted domains. The Ap-B primary structure contains a high consensual RNA binding RNP1 motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The whole consensus RNP motif is composed of two motifs RNP2 and RNP1, both are highly conserved and are usually found in simple or multiple copies (1 to 4). RNP domain folds into a compact and hydrophobic &#x003b1;&#x003b2; structure (&#x003b2;&#x003b1;&#x003b2; topology, a four anti-parallel &#x003b2;-sheet framed by 2 &#x003b1;-helices perpendicular one to another). RNP1 and RNP2 are found in the two central (underlined) strands, &#x003b2;4-<underline>&#x003b2;1&#x02013;&#x003b2;3</underline>-&#x003b2;2. In Ap-B, the absence of RNP2 motif and the fact that RNP1 is not included in a &#x003b2;-sheet could prevent a functional role in RNA binding. Indeed, the presence of this RNP1 motif could be attributed to a vestigial persistence resulting from gene duplications and a loss of nuclear functions in the course of the evolutionary process. Conversely, the presence of a different RNP domain in Ap-B structure could lead to the hypothesis that this protein has gained new interactions via new domains and new structures. RNP1 might be functional and form a particular structure with another motif than RNP2. Indeed, the Ap-B primary structure contains putative nuclear localization sequences and some data supports the hypothesis that this exopeptidase could migrate to the nuclear compartment (unpublished results). Further studies should demonstrate whether Ap-B is also a nuclear protein. In this case, the role of this RNP1 motif will remain to be clarified.</p><p>The COOH-terminal domains of LTA<sub>4</sub>H and Ap-B show a structural region similar to the Armadillo repeats or to the HEAT domains. These folds are usually composed of 3 to 36 pairs of anti-parallel &#x003b1;-helices that together form superhelices. The &#x003b1;-helices are commonly 37 to 47 amino acids long in the heat domains and about 40 amino acids long in the armadillo repeats. The known proteins containing these motifs share functions in protein-protein interaction/recognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Although this putative domain in Ap-B and LTA<sub>4</sub>H exhibits shorter &#x003b1;-helices (maximum of 15 residues), the super helical fold present in both structures could lead to variations in the strength of interactions and/or to different interacting proteins.</p><p>In addition to the potential HEAT domain, Ap-B exhibits several other features, such as putative SH3 domains, negative electrostatic potential, large hydrophobic patches leading to the hypothesis that this enzyme might interact with different partners in different functions. These characters are generally different from those of LTA<sub>4</sub>H and have been highlighted by the structural model proposed. Differences in the electrostatic potential distribution between Ap-B and LTA<sub>4</sub>H might reflect putative (or different) protein-protein interactions. Ap-B interacts with the outer cytoplasmic membrane of cells and this interaction might occur by protein-protein interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Ap-B participates, probably with different endopeptidases, to an initial maturation process of neuropeptides and pro-hormones that might involve an endopeptidase/aminopeptidase complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Similar roles could be attributed to hydrophobic patches, which delineate putative interacting surface. Ap-B exhibits larger hydrophobic patches than LTA<sub>4</sub>H. On the other hand, the negative electrostatic potential at the level of the catalytic site might explain the difference of enzyme specificity and between their respective substrates: rather negative for LTA<sub>4</sub>H, rather positive for Ap-B. Indeed, a long loop found in both enzymes (Ap-B, K<sup>395</sup>LRVKIEPGVDPDDTY<sup>410</sup>; LTA<sub>4</sub>H, K<sup>364</sup>LVVDLTDIDPDVAY<sup>378</sup>; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), delimits and separates the active center from the protein surface. This loop, containing a small &#x003b1;-helix, seems to be involved in substrate specificity as shown by site-directed mutagenesis studies (LTA<sub>4</sub>H, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]; TRH-DE, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]; Ap-B, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]) and structural data (LTA<sub>4</sub>H, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]). A detailed examination of the corresponding sequences shows that the LTA<sub>4</sub>H sequence is more hydrophobic than the Ap-B sequence, the latter exhibiting a high number of basic amino acids. Moreover, the distribution of acidic residues shows a significant difference in both loops. They are regularly distributed in the LTA<sub>4</sub>H loop structure and rather gathered up one end of the loop in Ap-B, the last aspartate residue belonging to the small &#x003b1;-helix pointing towards the active site.</p><p>This might explain the affinity and the positioning of the Ap-B substrate. Basic peptidic substrates might be attracted to the protein surface and to the active site by the negative electrostatic potential. Then, substrate could be guided towards the active center by the presence of hydrophobic and basic residues until stronger interactions occurred involving negatively charged aspartate. The presence of the &#x003b1;-helix might bring some precision and stability to the substrate binding mechanism, balancing the flexibility of the loop.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The structural model proposed is the first attempt for a better understanding at an atomic scale of the Ap-B protein. The Ap-B 3D model, based on the fold of LTA<sub>4</sub>H, yields important additional information that open the way to design new experiments. For instance, electrostatic potentials computed here, by nature, are features that can only be calculated from a 3D structure, they result from the superposition of the contribution of all the charges of the atoms in a given point. Consequently, a simple sequence analysis cannot foreshadow the electrostatic values. The results we described here illustrate clearly the necessity to go further than simply describing the main fold characteristics to detect fine surface properties of the protein. The important differences in these features compared to LTA<sub>4</sub>H show without ambiguity that the nature or the way the partners interact with Ap-B, the environment impact, would be different from LTA<sub>4</sub>H. Although the complete range of physiological functions of Ap-B remain to be discovered, previous data support the hypothesis that Ap-B is involved in a broad spectrum of relevant physiological phenomena. The specific exopeptidase activity of Ap-B participates in the final steps of neuropeptides and hormones processing (for review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]). Besides, the enzyme has been implicated in inflammation and/or tumor growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. These latter roles might be due to the <italic>in vitro </italic>residual capacity of Ap-B to hydrolyze the LTA<sub>4 </sub>into a lipid mediator of inflammation, the LTB<sub>4 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In the absence of high-resolution crystal structure, as demonstrated for aminopeptidase A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] and numerous other proteins, this model constitutes a powerful tool for investigating the importance and possible roles of conserved residues in Ap-B and M1 aminopeptidase catalytic sites and to gain new insight into their physiological functions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Construction of the prokaryotic recombinant rAp-B expression vector</title><p>The rat Ap-B cDNA was initially cloned into the SrfI-digested pPCR-Script vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, USA) to obtain the prAp-B plasmid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].

The protein extracts were centrifuged at 4,000 &#x000d7; g during 5 min at 4&#x000b0;C. The supernatants containing the soluble intracellular proteins were retained. Aliquots of protein extracts or purified proteins were run under denaturing conditions on an 8% polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE). Then, they were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (0.45 &#x003bc;m, Schleicher &#x00026; Schuell, Dassel, Germany) using a semi-dry blotting apparatus (Hoefer scientific instruments, San Francisco, USA). The rat Ap-B was detected with a specific anti-Ap-B polyclonal serum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] at a dilution of 1:2000. Antigen-antibody complexes were visualized using a goat alkaline phosphatase coupled secondary antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Quentin Fallavier, France) and an NBT-BCIP mixture (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Quentin Fallavier, France).

This system allows randomizing the targeted amino acids using oligonucleotides containing degenerate codons (see below). All the primers used for mutagenesis were 5'-phosphorylated. A single oligonucleotide per site was used in each experiment. The targeted amino acids and their corresponding mutagenic primers were the following: H325, 5'-TGTGGGAGATCTC<underline>ATR</underline>GATGATGACGTCGG-3' for the H325Y and H325H mutants, 5'- TGTGGGAGATCTC<underline>GAA</underline>GATGATGACGTCGG-3' for the H325F mutant, 5'- TGTGGGAGATCTC<underline>GGC</underline>GATGATGACGTCGG-3' for the H325A mutant; E326, 5'- ACTGTGGGAGAT<underline>STT</underline>GTGGATGATGACGTC-3' for the E326Q and E326E mutants, 5'- ACTGTGGGAGAT<underline>CKC</underline>GTGGATGATGACGTC-3' for the E326A and E326E mutants, 5'- ACTGTGGGAGAT<underline>WTC</underline>GTGGATGATGACGTC-3' for the E326D and E326E mutants, 5'- ACTGTGGGAGAT<underline>GTA</underline>GTGGATGATGACGTC-3' for the E326H mutant; H329, 5'-TTCCCAAACCAACT<underline>ATR</underline>GGAGATCTCGTGG-3' for H329Y and H329H mutants, 5'-TTCCCAAACCAACT<underline>GAA</underline>GGAGATCTCGTGG-3' for H329F mutant, 5'-TTCCCAAACCAACT<underline>GGC</underline>GGAGATCTCGTGG-3' for H329A mutant; E348, 5'-CATGGTGAAGCC<underline>MTC</underline>ATTGAGCCAGAATTC-3' for the E348D and E348E mutants, 5'-CATGGTGAAGCC<underline>CKC</underline>ATTGAGCCAGAATTC-3' for the E348A and E348E mutants, 5'-CATGGTGAAGCC<underline>CTS</underline>ATTGAGCCAGAATTC-3' for the E348Q and E348E mutants, 5'-CATGGTGAAGCC<underline>GTG</underline>ATTGAGCCAGAATTC-3' for the E348H mutant. Mutants such as H325H, E326E, H329H and E348E are conservative mutants. The mutagenic codon was underlined in the oligonucleotide sequence. The code for degenerate codons was: R = A, G; S = C, G; K = G, T; W = A, T; M = A, C. Generated mutants were identified by direct sequencing on both strands using the dideoxy chain-termination procedure (Genome Express facilities, Meylan, France).</p></sec><sec><title>Enzyme activity assays</title><p>Rat Ap-B activity was determined using the L-Arg- and L-Lys-&#x003b2;-naphthylamide (L-Arg-&#x003b2;-NA, L-Lys-&#x003b2;-NA; Sigma-Aldrich; Saint Quentin Fallavier, France) substrates and a specific inhibitor, arphamenine B (Sigma-Aldrich; Saint Quentin Fallavier, France) as previously described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Briefly, protein extracts were pre-incubated with or without 1 &#x003bc;M arphamenine B for 15 min at 37&#x000b0;C in assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4) prior to incubation at 37&#x000b0;C for 60 min in the assay buffer containing 0.2 mM L-Arg-&#x003b2;-NA. Hydrolysis was interrupted by the addition of 0.3 mL of freshly prepared color reagent (Fast Garnet GBC salt; Sigma-Aldrich; Saint Quentin Fallavier, France). The absorbance was read at 535 nm using a spectrophotometer. The percentage of rAp-B activity, which is equivalent to the percentage of inhibition, was measured by comparison with values obtained without inhibitor. Although no other peptidase activities were detectable in purified or semi-purified proteins, activity assays with wild type His-rAp-B enzyme were performed as described above.</p></sec><sec><title>Sequence analysis</title><p>Version 2.2.10 of the BLASTP program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>] was used, with default parameters (BLOSUM62 matrix), to identify members of the M1 family of metalloexopeptidases. The Uniprot database (Release 29.0) was queried with the rat Ap-B protein sequence (accession no U61696; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]) and 512 hits were observed. Among these hits, 500 amino acid sequences exhibiting an E value between 0 and 1.e<sup>-8 </sup>were selected. These 500 protein sequences were aligned using CLUSTALW version 1.0; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. The alignment was refined manually to minimize the number of gaps. Sequences, which exhibited obvious mistranslations resulting from sequencing errors, were deleted from the alignment. The complete listing of the sequence descriptions and the initial and final multiple alignments are available upon request. The PATTERNp program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>] was used to define the consensus amino acid signatures of the M1 family.</p></sec><sec><title>Molecular Modelling</title><p>Homology models were constructed as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Briefly, models were constructed with Modeller package 6.2 version using the 3D structure of the leukotriene A4 hydrolase in complex with Zinc ion and bestatin as a template [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In the template structure, the bestatin molecule is located in a tunnel-like cavity. In the model, we do not consider the bestatin molecule for two reasons: i) further theoretical parameters are required for optimizing the whole complexed structure and ii) leaving the cavity free permits a comparison of the difference or similarities in the physico-chemical features of the tunnel in both structures.</p><p>The alignment used is described in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>. Among the 100 models constructed that mainly differ in the indel regions, the 3D model with the optimal objective function was selected ("Initial Model"). Side chains were then repositioned with Scwrl3.0 software. Zinc ion was placed in an equivalent position as observed in the crystal structure of LTA<sub>4</sub>H. Structure refinement was performed with energy minimization <italic>in vacuum </italic>with NAMD package using Charmm force field parameters. A 12 &#x000c5; cutoff for coulombic interactions was used coupled with 8 &#x000c5; switching distance. The minimization process was performed in two steps: i) all the atoms of the protein were fixed while the Zn ion was free to move then ii) all the side chains and the Zn ion were free to reorient but the backbone was maintained fixed. The minimization procedure was performed until a gradient tolerance of 10<sup>-6 </sup>or less was reached. We did not perform any further minimisations freeing all the atoms because of the absence of a proper explicit environment and also for best maintaining the size of the bestatin pocket. The geometric quality of the structure was assessed with Procheck. The quality of the model was tested using 3D-evaluation tools available on the meta-server bioserv [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. The model was considered to be good with Verify3D, ProsaII and Eval23D, although the average scores were lower with the two last methods.</p></sec><sec><title>Structural Analysis</title><p>The structural analysis of the Ap-B model was performed as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Pocket cavities in the minimized structures were explored using the CastP server.</p><p>Electrostatic potentials were computed with Delphi. The dielectric interior and exterior were respectively fixed to 4 and 80. The computation was performed with a null salt concentration. A probe radius equal to 1.4 &#x000c5; was chosen. The charges and radii correspond to PARSE parameters. The potential was plotted on the surface computed with the MSMS software. A similar computation was performed on the equivalent domain of the LTA<sub>4</sub>H structure, corresponding to the aligned regions between the two sequences.</p><p>Hydrophobic patches on the surface were computed according to the Quilt approach. The results depend on different parameters that can be specified: atomic radii, probe radius, polar expansion and point density per atom. The computations were performed with an expansion value of 1.4 &#x000c5; for the radii of polar atoms (same as the probe radius) as suggested in the original publication. The number of point density per atom was equal to 252. Statistical relevance of patches was evaluated according to the randomization process proposed by the authors. We chose 10 iterations for the assessment.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p><bold>Ap-B: </bold>aminopeptidase B; <bold>rAp-B: </bold>rat aminopeptidase B; <bold>His-rAp-B: </bold>His-tagged rat aminopeptidase B; <bold>LTA</bold><sub>4</sub><bold>H: </bold>leukotri&#x000e8;ne A<sub>4 </sub>hydrolase; <bold>LTA</bold><sub>4</sub><bold>: </bold>leukotri&#x000e8;ne A<sub>4</sub>; <bold>LTB</bold><sub>4</sub><bold>: </bold>leukotri&#x000e8;ne B<sub>4</sub>; <bold>His-tag</bold>: histidine tag; <bold>PMSF: </bold>Phenylmethylsulfonyl Fluoride; <bold>NEM: </bold>N-ethylmaleimide; <bold>Ap-O: </bold>aminopeptidase O; <bold>TRH-DE: </bold>thyrotropin-releasing hormone degrading enzyme, <bold>HEAT domain: </bold>Hungtington-Elongation-A-subunit-TOR; <bold>RNP</bold>: ribonucleoprotein; <bold>F3: </bold>Tricorn interacting factor F3; <bold>ePepN: </bold>aminopeptidase N from <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>VLP, MSC, CGD, MCB and TF participated in the construction of the Ap-B expression vector.
