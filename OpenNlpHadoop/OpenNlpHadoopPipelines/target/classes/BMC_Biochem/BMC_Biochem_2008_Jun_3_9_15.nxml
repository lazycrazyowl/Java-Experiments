The toxins can cause death or produce serious edema in infected individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Despite many years of research, chromosomal loci have received little attention; however, a chromosomally-encoded cytotoxin, anthrolysin O, has been recently reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Arginase hydrolyzes L-arginine to L-ornithine and urea. This enzyme is found in both eubacteria and eucaryotes. However, relatively few eubacterial arginases have been characterized; most characterized arginases are from animals and yeasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. We recently characterized an arginase (RocF) from the gastric pathogen, <italic>Helicobacter pylori </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], discovering a number of interesting and unique properties among the arginase superfamily. When we began this current study, the closest homolog of the <italic>H. pylori </italic>arginase (NCBI Accession Number: NP_208190) was that from <italic>B. anthracis </italic>(NCBI Accession number: YP_016761 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Yet, the two RocF proteins share only 20% amino acid identity over the entire protein (27% when comparing the first 283 amino acids of <italic>H. pylori </italic>with the first 271 amino acids of <italic>B. anthracis</italic>). Arginase activity from <italic>H. pylori </italic>has recently been measured using a highly sensitive and quantitative assay that can determine enzyme activity from extracts, viable cells or the purified enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The <italic>rocF </italic>gene from <italic>H. pylori </italic>has been cloned into <italic>E. coli </italic>DH5&#x003b1; and confers arginase activity to <italic>E. coli </italic>(which does not possess a native arginase), suggesting that the <italic>rocF </italic>gene alone is sufficient to confer arginase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>L-arginine is used by macrophages to produce nitric oxide and other downstream reactive nitrogen species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The production of nitric oxide by activated host macrophages is an effective antimicrobial agent and serves as an initial innate defense mechanism against pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Interestingly, the <italic>H. pylori </italic>arginase inhibits host nitric oxide production, allowing for survival of the organism when co-cultured with activated macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. A similar situation likely occurs with the <italic>B. anthracis </italic>enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Additionally, <italic>H. pylori </italic>arginase decreases T lymphocyte proliferation and CD3&#x003b6; expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], arguing for the importance of this enzyme in multiple facets of host-pathogen interactions.</p><p>In addition to roles in pathogenesis, it is speculated that arginases have evolved to regulate the levels of arginine and ornithine within the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Regulation of these amino acids is pivotal in protein synthesis, polyamine and nitric oxide production, and other cellular processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. For example in <italic>H. pylori</italic>, expression of a second copy of the arginase gene, <italic>rocF</italic>, does not double the arginase activity, suggesting the bacterium has mechanisms to limit hydrolysis of the essential amino acid, arginine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>In organisms having a complete urea cycle, arginase is the final enzyme of the cycle; however, arginase is not found in most eubacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In <italic>H. pylori</italic>, the urea is further hydrolyzed into carbon dioxide and ammonia via the enzyme urease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Most eubacteria that contain an arginase also have the entire urea cycle. Examples include <italic>H. pylori </italic>and <italic>B. subtilis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. However, several arginase-containing bacteria apparently lack a complete urea cycle. Such organisms include <italic>B. licheniformis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and <italic>B. anthracis</italic>. This suggests that arginase in these latter bacteria has evolved a unique physiologic role in the cell. Several biochemical properties of the <italic>B. anthracis </italic>arginase had been preliminarily described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Purified <italic>B. anthracis </italic>arginase had to be preactivated with 1 &#x003bc;M Mn<sup>2+ </sup>(MnSO<sub>4</sub>) and heat (37&#x000b0;C for 3 hours) (designated as heat-activation) for activity to be measured using a urea detection method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Indeed, nearly all arginases require some type of heat activation step in the presence of manganese for catalytic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. For <italic>B. anthracis </italic>arginase, manganese was previously considered the most efficient cation activator and stabilizer, allowing the Mn<sup>2+</sup>-preactivated enzyme to maintain stability and activity even after exposure to 50&#x02013;60&#x000b0;C for one hour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Additionally, the enzyme showed optimal catalytic activity between pH 9.8 and 10.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], a finding consistent will all arginases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], except the <italic>H. pylori </italic>enzyme (see results) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Activity of the purified <italic>B. anthracis </italic>arginase decreased significantly after dialysis and lyophilization; if the manganese-preactivated enzyme was treated with other divalent cations, a large decrease in arginase catalytic activity occurred [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Collectively, these earlier data suggested that the metal cofactor involved in <italic>B. anthracis </italic>arginase activity was manganese [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], with nickel and cobalt having no role or an inhibitory role. The earlier data also indicated that heat-activation was absolutely required for catalytic activity. Identification of the gene responsible for <italic>B. anthracis </italic>arginase was not previously reported.</p><p>While the toxin components produced by <italic>B. anthracis </italic>have been the primary focus of research, there is limited research on the organism's other genes and gene products. In this study, we sought to characterize in depth the chromosomally-encoded <italic>B. anthracis </italic>arginase using a variety of conditions not previously examined, using a sensitive enzyme assay. We also established an <italic>E. coli </italic>model for the <italic>B. anthracis </italic>arginase and determined whether arginase could be detected and characterized from viable organisms. We provide evidence that the enzyme has novel features not previously recognized. For example, the <italic>B. anthracis </italic>arginase displayed optimal activity with nickel in extracts and manganese in viable cells, but surprisingly did not absolutely require either heat activation or the addition of exogenous metal to detect arginase activity. The <italic>B. anthracis </italic>arginase gene could complement an <italic>H. pylori </italic>arginase mutant, conferring <italic>B. anthracis </italic>arginase-like properties to <italic>H. pylori</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Characterization of arginase-containing extracts of <italic>B. anthracis </italic>7702</title><p>Many holes remain in our knowledge of the chromosomally-encoded arginase from <italic>B. anthracis</italic>. Also, no two eubacterial arginases have ever been directly compared for their properties under identical conditions. We therefore sought to investigate the <italic>B. anthracis </italic>arginase in much more detail and compared it to the <italic>H. pylori </italic>arginase. Extracts from <italic>B. anthracis </italic>7702 assayed with manganese (Mn<sup>2+</sup>) or cobalt (Co<sup>2+</sup>) displayed arginase activity at both pH 6.3 and 9.0; however, when assayed in the presence of nickel (Ni<sup>2+</sup>) at pH 9.0, the activity was up to 500-fold higher than with Mn<sup>2+ </sup>or Co<sup>2+ </sup>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). This is in striking contrast to what was reported previously for this enzyme, in which Ni<sup>2+ </sup>inhibited activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold><italic>B. anthracis </italic>7702 extracts show optimal catalytic activity with nickel</bold>.

Micromolar nickel activated arginase &#x0003e;2-fold more than the optimal level of manganese (400 U versus 125 U) and &#x0003e;100-fold higher than the optimal level of cobalt (400 U versus 12 U). Optimal concentrations for the three metals were as follows: nickel, &#x02265; 500 &#x003bc;M; manganese, &#x02265; 12.5 mM; and cobalt 5 mM (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A&#x02013;D</xref>).

In striking contrast, <italic>B. anthracis </italic>contains arginase, but lacks the other enzymes of the urea cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The role of arginase in <italic>B. anthracis </italic>pathogenesis and cellular physiology is only recently becoming understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], but our knowledge is far from complete. This current study uncovered novel characteristics about the enzyme as expressed in <italic>E. coli </italic>and in <italic>B. anthracis</italic>, and therefore lays important groundwork for future experiments in these areas. For the first time, it is demonstrated that the <italic>rocF </italic>gene from <italic>B. anthracis </italic>is the gene responsible for arginase activity, since <italic>E. coli </italic>containing <italic>B. anthracis rocF </italic>possessed arginase activity, while a kanamycin insertion into <italic>rocF </italic>abolished arginase activity. Thus, <italic>rocF </italic>was necessary and sufficient to confer arginase activity to <italic>E. coli</italic>. These results do not, however, rule out the possibility that <italic>B. anthracis </italic>contains genes that influence arginase expression or activity. Indeed, the <italic>B. anthracis </italic>genome contains a homologue of RocR, a positive transcriptional activator of the arginase-containing operon in <italic>B. subtilis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Based on previous studies using the purified <italic>B. anthracis </italic>arginase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], it was expected that the enzyme would be most active with manganese as its metal cofactor. In contrast, we identified nickel as the optimum metal cofactor for arginase activity in <italic>B. anthracis </italic>extracts, with purified His<sub>6</sub>-BaRocF, and with extracts from <italic>E. coli </italic>(pBS-<italic>barocF</italic>). Peak <italic>B. anthracis </italic>arginase activity was reached with much lower nickel concentrations than with manganese or cobalt. This suggests that in a cell-free system, the arginase has highest activity with nickel. The reason for the differences between our studies and those published previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] may be the use of an improved enzyme assay, coupled with our ability to assay the enzyme in multiple model systems that were unavailable 25 years ago. To our knowledge, this is the first arginase to have optimal activity with nickel. However, it is recognized that the actual metal found <italic>in vivo </italic>in <italic>B. anthracis </italic>native arginase is critical to study in the near future by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry analysis. Such work cannot be accomplished with the current purified protein due to presence of the His<sub>6 </sub>tag and use of a nickel-containing column to purify the protein.</p><p><italic>B. anthracis </italic>arginase was active with cobalt, manganese, and nickel. Therefore, depending on the pH and growth conditions, <italic>B. anthracis </italic>arginase can promiscuously utilize various metals to achieve catalytic activity.

This implies that the substrate, L-arginine, was transported into the cells, and was converted to urea and L-ornithine; the latter was measured in this study. Viable <italic>B. anthracis </italic>cells have up to ten-fold higher arginase activity with manganese than with cobalt or nickel (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). This finding seemingly contradicts our earlier finding that the <italic>B. anthracis </italic>arginase in cell-free systems has highest activity with nickel. Two possible interpretations of this discrepancy are that i) <italic>B. anthracis </italic>arginase actually uses manganese rather than nickel <italic>in vivo </italic>and ii) <italic>B. anthracis </italic>arginase uses nickel, manganese or cobalt, depending on the situation. Since viable <italic>B. anthracis </italic>displayed a remarkable increase in arginase activity when the organisms were grown with extremely low levels of manganese (200 nM), we propose that <italic>B. anthracis </italic>expresses a very high affinity and specificity manganese transporter under our experimental conditions; this transporter would not be expected to transport nickel or cobalt, since addition of these metals did not increase <italic>B. anthracis </italic>arginase activity in viable cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). It is speculated that such a transporter would be able to scavenge manganese from sites expected to be very low in manganese concentrations, such as would exist <italic>in vivo</italic>. Additional experiments are warranted to directly determine the metal cofactor found in the <italic>B. anthracis </italic>arginase active site.</p><p>The heat-activation step, which involves heating arginase at 50&#x02013;60&#x000b0;C in the presence of metal, is required to obtain arginase activity in <italic>H. pylori </italic>and many other previously characterized arginases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that heat-activation decreases <italic>B. anthracis </italic>arginase activity if manganese is absent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]; we observed this with the purified protein as well. In contrast, we found that heating purified arginase in the presence of nickel dramatically improves activity over that of arginase that had not been heat-activated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This result suggests that arginase may fold in a more ideal conformation with heat treatment in the presence of nickel than with cobalt or manganese, raising the possibility that nickel is the physiologic metal cofactor used by <italic>B. anthracis </italic>arginase. Despite these observations, however, substantial <italic>B. anthracis </italic>arginase activity still remains without heat-activation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>), unlike the case for most previously characterized arginases. Moreover, <italic>B. anthracis </italic>arginase has substantial activity without exogenously added metal (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), suggesting that sufficient levels of the residual metal cofactor may already be tightly bound to the enzyme's active site. This raises the possibility that the metal cofactor is more tightly bound to <italic>B. anthracis </italic>RocF than it is in other arginases. All of the other arginase have been proposed to have at least one of the two metal ions loosely bound to the active site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>We demonstrated that the <italic>H. pylori rocF </italic>mutant devoid of arginase activity could regain arginase activity with <italic>B. anthracis</italic>-like properties when the <italic>rocF </italic>mutant was complemented with the <italic>B. anthracis rocF </italic>gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>), suggesting that the <italic>B. anthracis </italic>RocF protein itself harbors at least some of the properties that allow it to have optimal activity with nickel. However, the <italic>B. anthracis rocF </italic>gene did not fully restore arginase activity to <italic>H. pylori </italic>even though a strongly active <italic>H. pylori </italic>urease promoter was used. This lack of full restoration may be due to codon usage differences between <italic>H. pylori </italic>and <italic>B. anthracis </italic>or to species-specific proteins that affect arginase activity. For example, <italic>H. pylori </italic>may have an arginase metal-delivering chaperone that does not recognize the <italic>B. anthracis </italic>enzyme. It is also possible that <italic>H. pylori </italic>has mechanisms to prevent arginase activity from becoming too high, which could lead to arginine starvation, since it was previously shown that wild type <italic>H. pylori </italic>carrying two copies of the arginase gene only have 25% more arginase activity than the wild type strain with a single copy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Arginine is an essential amino acid for <italic>H. pylori </italic>but not <italic>B. anthracis</italic>. <italic>B. anthracis </italic>can therefore have much higher arginase activity without starving itself for arginine, since <italic>B. anthracis </italic>can synthesize more arginine intracellularly.</p><p>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> summarizes the properties of a subset of eubacterial arginases.

For example, multiple metals can be used for the arginase of <italic>B. caldovelox </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], while sporulation induces arginase in <italic>B. licheniformis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], and the exosporium of spores from <italic>B. anthracis </italic>contain arginase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. While the putative metal-binding region is nearly completely conserved among the <italic>Bacillus </italic>species, there are a number of differences compared to the <italic>H. pylori </italic>arginase that may serve as important residues to target for site-directed mutagenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The <italic>H. pylori </italic>arginase displays unique pH (6.0) and metal (cobalt) optima within the arginase superfamily. From the results of this study, the <italic>B. anthracis </italic>arginase likely displays a unique metal (nickel) optimum in the arginase superfamily and can potentially use multiple metals (cobalt, nickel, or manganese) to achieve catalytic activity suitable for its niche. Characteristic differences in arginases of <italic>B. anthracis </italic>versus <italic>H. pylori </italic>may reflect distinct <italic>in vivo </italic>niches occupied by these organisms. This study provides the foundation for further examination of the role of arginase in <italic>B. anthracis </italic>pathogenesis and cellular physiology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains, growth conditions, and plasmids</title><p><italic>Escherichia coli </italic>strain DH5&#x003b1; [F<sup>-</sup>, <italic>deoR</italic>, <italic>thi-1</italic>, <italic>gyrA96</italic>, <italic>recA1</italic>, <italic>endA1</italic>, <italic>relA1</italic>, <italic>supE44</italic>, &#x00394; (<italic>lacZYA</italic>-<italic>argF</italic>) <italic>U169</italic>, <italic>hsdR17 </italic>(<italic>r</italic><sup>-</sup>, <italic>m</italic><sup>+</sup>), <italic>&#x003c6; </italic>80d <italic>lacZ&#x00394;M15</italic>, &#x003bb;<sup>-</sup>] (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used for standard cloning and transformation procedures.
