Estradiol-induced ER&#x003b1; signaling is indispensable for many physiological processes including reproductive tissue development (uterus, mammary gland, and ovary), bone metabolism, and immune, cardiovascular, and neurological function(1-3). Importantly, ER&#x003b1; has remained the primary pharmacological target for endocrine therapy of ER&#x003b1; positive breast cancer. Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) such as tamoxifen, as well as estrogen ablation are front line therapies for the treatment of ER&#x003b1;-expressing breast neoplasias.</p><p>Various aspects of ER&#x003b1; transcriptional activation are dependent on phosphorylation of the receptor. Coactivator recruitment, subcellular localization, receptor dimerization, ligand binding, and posttranslational modifications are regulated through the phosphorylation of individual sites of ER&#x003b1;. Nine ER&#x003b1; phosphorylation sites have been functionally characterized to date: serines 102 (S102), 104 (S104), 106 (S106), 118 (S118), and 167 (S167) in the AF-1 domain; serine 236 (S236) in the DNA binding domain; and serines 305 (S305), threonine 311 (T311), and tyrosine 537 (Y537) in the AF-2/ligand binding domain (LBD) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The functional interaction of ER&#x003b1; with coregulator proteins such as CBP/p300 and the p160 family of coactivators is regulated by phosphorylation of ER&#x003b1; in the AF-1 domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. S118 is phosphorylated in response to both estradiol and epidermal growth factor through CDK7 and ERK1/2 dependent pathways, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Phosphorylation of S118 in conjunction with S104 and S106 mediates ligand independent activation of ER&#x003b1; by facilitating functional ER&#x003b1; interactions with the transcriptional coactivators CBP and SRC-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. It has also been demonstrated that glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) can mediate phosphorylation of S102, S104, S106, and S118 <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>vitro</italic>, where S102 phosphorylation is dependent on pS104 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. S167 of ER&#x003b1; is also phosphorylated in response to epidermal growth factor receptor signaling through p90 RSK (p90 ribosomal S6 kinase), thereby significantly enhancing ER&#x003b1; transcriptional activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. This laboratory demonstrated that src kinase dependent activation of AKT resulted in phosphorylation of ER&#x003b1; at S167 and this site was necessary for src mediated ER&#x003b1; transcriptional activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Additionally, protein kinase CK2 which is upregulated in most proliferating tissues, phosphorylates S167 and regulates interaction of ER&#x003b1; with estrogen response elements (ERE) <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Estrogen receptor &#x003b1; (ER&#x003b1;) phosphorylation sites</bold>. The schematic in Figure 1 depicts both previously identified and novel ER&#x003b1; phosphorylation sites with relative locations within the ER&#x003b1; functional domains. Serines 104, 106, 118, and 167 constitute phosphorylation sites within the ligand-independent activation function-1 (AF-1) domain of ER&#x003b1;. S236 is the first phosphorylation site within the DNA binding domain of ER&#x003b1;. Serine 305, threonine 311 and tyrosine 537 are phosphorylation sites identified within the ligand-dependent activation function-2 (AF-2) domain.

S46/47 constitutes an additional site of phosphorylation within the AF-1 domain. Serines 282 and 294 are located in the hinge domain of ER&#x003b1; proximal to the DNA binding domain. Of note, S559 is the first phosphorylation site identified in the extreme C-terminal F domain of ER&#x003b1; and other steroid receptors. S154, S212, S294, S554, and S559 have been recently identified or independently confirmed by mass spectrophotometry (11).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2091-10-36-1"/></fig><p>In addition to phosphorylation sites that have been functionally characterized, recent studies have identified novel phosphorylation events at sites S102, S154, S212, S294, S554, and S559 by mass spectrophotometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Concurrent studies described herein have confirmed S294 and S559 as bona fide ER&#x003b1; phosphorylation sites using phospho-peptide mapping and have ascribed the initial functional significance of these sites to ER&#x003b1; transcriptional activity. Additionally, antibodies utilized within this study have detected <italic>in vivo </italic>phosphorylation of S282, S294, and S559 in immunohistochemical analysis of human breast carcinoma tissue microarrays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Until recently, evidence for a role of ER&#x003b1; phosphorylation in breast cancer had been extrapolated from breast cancer cell line models. However, recent studies demonstrate that ER&#x003b1; phosphorylation may significantly impact ER&#x003b1; signaling in human tissues. Immunohistochemical studies have demonstrated S118 phosphorylation of ER&#x003b1; in breast cancer patient biopsies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. S118 phosphorylation was associated with improved disease free survival despite the ability of S118 phosphorylation to mediate ligand independent ER&#x003b1; function and association of S118 phosphorylation with EGFR signaling, a known contributor to tamoxifen resistance in tissue culture models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, S118 phosphorylation was directly associated with tamoxifen sensitivity as well as with a more highly differentiated tumor phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Another study, however, found that ER&#x003b1; S118 phosphorylation was related to Her2 expression and tamoxifen resistance upon patient relapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. S167 phosphorylation has also been correlated to responsiveness to endocrine therapy as well as increased disease free and overall survival in breast cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Interestingly, S167 is downstream of AKT signaling which has been associated with tamoxifen resistance and agonist activity in endometrial cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Most recently, it has been reported that low levels of S118 phosphorylation accompanied by high levels of S167 phosphorylation were associated with increased overall survival and disease-free survival in a study of breast cancer patient biopsies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Furthermore it was recently suggested that phosphorylation of serine 305 in premenopausal women with breast cancer was related to tamoxifen resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Although the number of clinical studies correlating ER&#x003b1; phosphorylation and patient prognosis/outcome are relatively few, these studies present the possibility that ER&#x003b1; phosphorylation could be predictive of responsiveness to endocrine therapy in ER&#x003b1; positive breast cancer.</p><p>A number of reports indicate that the most studied of the previously identified ER&#x003b1; phosphorylation sites are not the critical targets of signaling pathways that regulate the relative antagonist or agonist properties of tamoxifen. Three N-terminal serine phosphorylation sites (S104, S106, S118) in ER&#x003b1; were shown to be necessary, but not sufficient for growth factor potentiation of ligand-dependent activation and ligand-independent activation of the ER&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Of significance from these studies was the recognition that at least three otherER&#x003b1; serine phosphorylation sites remained to be identified <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>With the expectation that additional ER&#x003b1; phosphorylation sites may play a primary role in the modulation of ER&#x003b1; function, the present study sought to identify novel ER&#x003b1; phosphorylation sites employing <italic>in vivo </italic>labeling of mammalian cells with [P<sup>32</sup>]H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, phosphopeptide mapping and biochemical identification of sites. The present study has identified four novel ER&#x003b1; phosphorylation sites <italic>in vivo </italic>at serine residues S46/47, 282, 294, and 559.

Briefly, COS-1 cells expressing ER&#x003b1; were labeled <italic>in vivo</italic>, with [P<sup>32</sup>]H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4 </sub>and ER&#x003b1; was immunopurified and fractionated by SDS-PAGE. A small aliquot was used to confirm purification of ER&#x003b1; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Following autoradiography of the wet gel, the 67Kd band corresponding to ER&#x003b1; was excised, subjected to tryptic digestion, and ER&#x003b1; tryptic peptides were separated on a C-18 reverse-phase HPLC column using a 0-45% acetonitrile gradient. Radiolabeled peptides were collected and electrophoresed on a 40% alkaline acrylamide gel and autoradiographed to reveal sites of P<sup>32 </sup>incorporation corresponding to ER&#x003b1; phosphorylation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Subsequently, phosphopeptides were subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis and modified manual Edman degradation to determine the position of each phosphoamino acid within the phosphopeptides. Data was obtained for individual phosphopeptides isolated from HPLC fractions or alkaline polyacrylamide gels containing each of the four major phosphopeptides labeled A-D in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>. Phosphoamino acid analysis indicated that each phosphopeptide contained only phospho-serine (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Modified manual Edman degradation determined the position of P<sup>32</sup>phosphorylated amino acids within each phosphopeptide as follows: phosphopeptide A, P<sup>32 </sup>release at cycle 5; phosphopeptide B, P<sup>32</sup>release at cycle 4; phosphopeptide C, P<sup>32 </sup>release at cycle 7, and; phosphopeptide D, P<sup>32 </sup>release at cycle 10 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). Comparison of these results to the predicted tryptic peptides of ER&#x003b1; revealed a single candidate phosphopeptide for phosphopeptide A and for phosphopeptide B (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The phosphorylation site in phosphopeptide A was identified as serine 282 and the site in phosphopeptide B was identified as serine 559. S559 phosphorylation has been recently reported by Atsriku <italic>et al</italic>. through MALDI-TOF mass spectrophotometry in ER&#x003b1; + MCF-7 cells, thereby validating that S559 is a phosphorylation site for ER&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. For phosphopeptide C there were four candidate peptides predicted to have a cycle 7 serine release by manual Edman degradation (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). S294 was a predicted substrate for Ser/Pro directed kinases and this sequence is conserved among nuclear receptors (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Two of the other three candidates for phosphopeptide C were not predicted to be phosphorylation sites according to NetPhosK phosphorylation prediction models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The fourth candidate, S527, was a predicted substrate for PKC but the sequence is not conserved among nuclear receptors. Therefore of the four candidate phosphopeptides, S294 was the most likely candidate for the phosphorylated residue contained within peptide C. As with S559, S294 has recently been confirmed as a ER&#x003b1; phosphorylation site by MALDI-TOF mass spectrophotometry in MCF-7 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Similarly for phosphopeptide D, two possible peptides were predicted to have a cycle 10 serine release by manual Edman degradation; either S47 or S193. S47 was contained in an imperfect consensus sequence for PKC whereas S193 was not within a predicted kinase recognition sequence (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Identification of ER&#x003b1; phosphorylated at serine residues 47, 282, 294 and 559</bold>. 6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8 </sup>COS-1 cells were cultured in phenol red free DMEM supplemented with 10% charcoal stripped FBS.

ER&#x003b1; mutants were expressed in COS-1 cells and P<sup>32</sup>phosphopeptide maps were prepared and compared to phosphopeptide maps of wild-type (wt) ER&#x003b1; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A-E</xref>). Phosphopeptide maps of S294A or S559A resulted in specific loss of phosphopeptides C and B, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B-C</xref>). The phosphopeptide map of S47A resulted in reduced intensity but not complete loss of phosphopeptide D (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). A close examination of the first tryptic cleavage site directly C-terminal to S47 revealed a lysine-proline sequence at residues 48-49. Trypsin cleaves inefficiently at R/K-proline sequences making it possible that phosphopeptide D was the result of an incomplete tryptic digest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The next trypsin cleavage site following an incomplete digest at K48 occurs at residue R142 and digestion at this site would result in a very large phosphopeptide of 110 amino acids. The possibility of an incomplete tryptic digest at K48 was consistent with the relative migration of phosphopeptide D at the top of the alkaline acrylamide gel, and the elution of this phosphopeptide in the later fractions from the C18 reversed phase column (25). Since the previously identified ER&#x003b1; phosphorylation sites S104, S106, and S118 would also be present in the very large phosphopeptide resulting from incomplete digestion of K48, an ER&#x003b1; expression plasmid was constructed containing four serine-to-alanine mutations at S47, S104, S106, and S118 and a phosphopeptide map of this protein was prepared. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>, S47A/S104A/S106A/S118A resulted in complete loss of phosphopeptide D consistent with the interpretation that all four phosphorylation sites S47, S104, S106, and S118 were present in phosphopeptide D. Additionally, it was noted that phosphopeptide C was diminished upon mutation of S104, S106, S47 and S118, suggesting that S294 phosphorylation, or a site within a peptide which co-migrates electrophoretically with peptide C may be dependent upon phosphorylation of one or several sites within the D peptide (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>).</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Mutation of serine residues to alanine eliminates specific phosphorylation of peptides</bold>.

Furthermore, SRC-1 association with ER&#x003b1; was increased upon deletion of the F domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Another report demonstrated that the intact ER&#x003b1; F-domain inhibited the association of unliganded ER with REA (Repressor of Estrogen Receptor) using <italic>in vitro </italic>GST pull down assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. These studies indicate that the F-domain of ER&#x003b1; was responsible for the inhibition of ER&#x003b1; association with both coactivators (SRC-1) and corepressors (REA). Although these findings do not directly implicate a central role for S559 phosphorylation in coregulator recruitment, it does highlight the importance of the F-domain in ER&#x003b1;/coregulator interactions. Interestingly, another report suggested that point mutations of S559 and E562 to alanine disrupted a predicted helix in the F-domain that resulted in a slight inhibition of ligand independent transcriptional activity and an enhanced estradiol-activation of ER&#x003b1; mediated gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>The phosphorylation of S282 and S294 may also be important for regulating ER&#x003b1; function. The location of S282 and S294 in the hinge region near the DBD is suggestive of a role for these phosphorylation sites in DNA binding and/or dimerization of ER&#x003b1;. The present data, however suggest that phosphorylation of these residues lead to opposing effects on ER&#x003b1; mediated transcription (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Reporter gene data suggest that phosphorylation at S282, much like S559, was involved in the suppression of unliganded ER&#x003b1; activity. However, mutation of S282 also resulted in increased estradiol-dependent loss of ER protein. As such, the impact of S282 phosphorylation may be biphasic. In the transient setting, S282 phosphorylation may result in attenuated transcriptional activity but may lend to long term stabilization of ER protein levels allowing transcriptional activity to persist over time. S294 mutation to alanine resulted in a suppressive effect in reporter assays but not in expression of the endogenous estrogen regulated gene pS2. One likely explanation is that the complexity of the endogenous pS2 promoter allows other transcription factors/transcriptional regulators to compensate for loss of ER&#x003b1; function caused by mutation of S294 to alanine. The pS2 promoter does indeed contain an AP-1 site that is thought to act in concert with the ERE to mediate transcriptional activity. In this setting, slight changes in ERE mediated transcriptional function may be compensated with the AP-1 site.</p><p>S46/47 phosphorylation may play a role in the ligand dependent activation of ER&#x003b1;. Data suggested that S46, and not S47, is responsible for regulating ER&#x003b1; transcriptional activity. S47 which was identified by biochemical means, may be phosphorylated due to a "bystander effect" in which kinases, (presumably PKC isoforms) are directed to the S46 site but may phosphorylate both the S46 and the weaker recognition site, S47. Alternatively, S46 and S47 phosphorylation events could be distinct events. Indeed, S46 lies within an imperfect protein kinase C recognition motif as does S47 and mutation of S46 results in substantial inhibition of ERE-luciferase activity in HeLa cells but was not identified biochemically as an ER&#x003b1; phosphorylation site. Interestingly, mutation of S46 or S46/47 does not lead to the electrophoretic up shift observed upon mutation of S47 alone suggesting that these sites play distinct roles in ER transcriptional regulation. These data can only be suggestive of S46 phosphorylation as there has been no direct biochemical evidence that S46 is phosphorylated. As with the other four A/B region phosphorylation sites (S104, S106, S118, S167), S47 may contribute to the ligand independent and ligand dependent function of the receptor. In agreement with this assertion it has been demonstrated that murine ER&#x003b1; transcriptional activity is induced by PKC&#x003b4; through the AF-1 domain and that PKC&#x003b4; activity leads to phosphorylation of mouse ER&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Nonspecificity of the &#x003b1;-pS47 antibody precluded further experiments that would have been necessary to determine if PKC is indeed necessary for the phosphorylation of S46/47 and if this mediates the transcriptional induction of ER&#x003b1; through the PKC pathway.</p><p>The finding that S282 and S559 were phosphorylated <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro </italic>by protein kinase CK2 indicates a central role for CK2 in the regulation of ER&#x003b1; transcriptional activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Previous studies indicate that CK2 enhances ER&#x003b1; DNA binding <italic>in vitro </italic>and that CK2 phosphorylates ER&#x003b1; at serine 167 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Previous work from this laboratory demonstrated that mutation of S167 to alanine markedly reduced ER&#x003b1; transcriptional activity and disrupted ER&#x003b1; interaction with endogenous promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. S282 and S559 represent the second and third sites of ER&#x003b1; regulation by CK2. Remarkably, mutation of S282 or S559 to alanine resulted in near opposite functional effects on ER&#x003b1; as compared to mutation of S167 to alanine. ER&#x003b1; ligand independent transcriptional activity was markedly enhanced upon mutation of S282 and S559 to alanine whereas estradiol mediated activation remained equivalent to wt ER&#x003b1; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). These findings suggested that CK2 phosphorylation maintains ER&#x003b1; in a state in which basal ligand independent activity is suppressed while responsiveness to ligand is retained. This is significant in that CK2 overexpression has been observed in several cancers including breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. It has also recently been demonstrated that several tamoxifen resistant breast cancer cell lines showed greater susceptibility to apoptosis upon inhibition of CK2 compared to tamoxifen sensitive MCF-7 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Additionally, developmental mouse models reveal a causative role for CK2 in breast cancer in which MMTV-CK2&#x003b1; transgenic mice form mammary tumors at a frequency of 35% as compared to &#x0003e; 1% in wt FVB mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Therefore, the signaling axis of ER&#x003b1; and CK2 in breast cancer is of great interest and provides a putative target for therapeutic intervention.</p><p>The signaling axis between CK2 activity and ER&#x003b1; transcriptional regulation has yet to be elucidated. Though mutagenesis of sites demonstrated that absence of a phosphorylation event at S282 and S559 positively regulated ER transcriptional activity, inhibition of CK2 by DMAT inhibited ER transcriptional activity (data not shown). One possibility to explain these findings is that CK2 may be necessary for the activity of transcriptional coregulators involved in ER signaling. A second explanation may be that ER is phosphorylated by CK2 at additional sites (e.g. S167).</p><p>Sequence alignment analysis (Megalign&#x02122;, DNA*Star) was used to determine conservation of phosphorylation at S47, S282, S294, and S559 among other nuclear receptors. S47, which lies in the highly heterologous and heavily phosphorylated AF-1 region of ER&#x003b1;, was difficult to align with AF-1 regions of other nuclear receptors and consequently it was difficult to assess conservation of this site among receptors. However because there is more homology within the DBD, hinge and LBD regions of nuclear receptors, phosphorylation at sites equivalent to S282, S294 and S559 may be more highly conserved among nuclear receptors. The hAR (human androgen receptor) is phosphorylated by stress kinases (ie. Jun N-terminal Kinase, p38 MAP kinase) within the hAR hinge region (S650), a site that is homologous to and aligns closely with S282 of ER&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Interestingly, the (<bold>S)</bold>PTEE sequence encompassing S650 comprises a putative CK2 recognition motif as does S282, suggesting some conservation in phosphorylation between ER&#x003b1; and hAR. Functionally, S650 phosphorylation of the hAR is suggested to regulate nuclear export [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. The hPR-B (human progesterone receptor B) is phosphorylated in the hinge region by CDK2 at S676 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. However S676 phosphorylation has not been ascribed mechanistic relevance in hPR-B function and this site does not align closely with ER&#x003b1; S282 or hAR S650 in alignment analysis. It is possible however, that phosphorylation of hPR-B at S676 is homologous to ER&#x003b1; S294. S294 is likely targeted by Serine-Proline (Ser-Pro) directed kinases and is located within the hinge domain of ER&#x003b1;. Regarding S559 phosphorylation, to date no phosphorylation site has been identified in the F domain of steroid receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>Motif analysis identified kinase recognition sequences in other nuclear receptors that may be analogous to CK2 phosphorylation of S282 and S559. ER&#x003b2; has putative CK2 recognition sites at S234 (<bold>S</bold>ADE) and S513 (<bold>S</bold>PAE). S225 of RXR&#x003b1; (retinoid &#x000d7; receptor alpha) is contained within a putative CK2 site (SANE) that aligns with, and may be homologous to, S282 of ER&#x003b1;. The relatively high number of putative CK2 phosphorylation sites within nuclear receptors may indicate that CK2 phosphorylation is intrinsically linked to cell cycle progression given that CK2 expression and activity is increased in highly proliferating tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].</p><p>These studies represent the first characterization of four newly identified phosphorylation sites within ER&#x003b1;. One caveat to these findings is the use of ER&#x003b1; (-) HeLa cells to determine the impact of each phosphorylation site on ER&#x003b1; transcriptional activity. HeLa cells only weakly support AF-1 activity of ER&#x003b1;. As such, these studies may represent mechanisms that are primarily representative of AF-2 regulation. Indeed, three of the four identified phosphorylation sites lie outside of the AF1 domain suggesting that these sites may function independently of AF-1. However this does not preclude phosphorylation dependent interaction between AF-1 and AF-2 domains. Despite these limitations, Hela cells support ER&#x003b1; transcriptional activity in luciferase reporters and demonstrate the regulation of endogenous estradiol regulated genes. Additionally, because the cells are ER&#x003b1; (-), the influence of endogenous ER&#x003b1; expression on estradiol-mediated gene transcription is not present.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The study presented herein describes the initial identification and/or functional characterization of S46/47, S282, S294, and S559 as phosphorylation sites within ER&#x003b1;. These studies show that phosphorylation at S46/47 or at S294 likely potentiate ER&#x003b1; transcriptional activity whereas S282 and S559 phosphorylation are likely to negatively regulate ER&#x003b1; transcriptional activity as evidence by mutational analysis. Additionally, this study identified protein kinase CK2 as the kinase responsible for the phosphorylation of ER&#x003b1; at S282 and S559. The identification and characterization of phosphorylation at S46/47, S282, S294, and S559 provides additional insight into regulation of ER&#x003b1; signaling. Ultimately, the impact of ER&#x003b1; phosphorylation at these sites will provide new diagnostic tools in breast cancer and may lead to novel therapeutic strategies to target ER&#x003b1; signaling.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Tissue culture and transfection</title><p>COS-1 monkey embryonic kidney cells, HeLa human cervical cancer cells, MCF-7 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA), and MCF-7-LCC2 (from Robert Clarke, Ph.D., Georgetown Univ.) were cultured in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 5% penicillin/streptomycin at 37&#x000b0;C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.
