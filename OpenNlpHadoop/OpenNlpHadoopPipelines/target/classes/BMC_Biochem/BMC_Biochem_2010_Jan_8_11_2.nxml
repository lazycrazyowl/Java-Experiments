A downstream effect essential for the weight-regulatory action of leptin is the phosphorylation and activation of the latent transcription factor STAT3 by LEPRb-associated Janus kinases (JAKs). Obesity is typically associated with chronically elevated leptin levels and a decreased ability of LEPRb to activate intracellular signal transduction pathways (leptin resistance).

Overexpression and RNA interference-mediated downregulation of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) revealed that both Tyr985 and Tyr1077 were capable of supporting the negative modulatory effect of SOCS3 in reporter gene assays. In contrast, the inhibitory effect of SOCS1 was enhanced by the presence of Tyr985 but not Tyr1077. Finally, the reduction of the STAT-phosphorylating activity of the LEPRb complex after 2 h of leptin stimulation was not accompanied by the dephosphorylation or degradation of LEPRb or the receptor-associated JAK molecule, but depended on Tyr985 and/or Tyr1077.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Both Tyr985 and Tyr1077 contribute to the negative regulation of LEPRb signaling.

Leptin deficiency of humans or rodents results in hyperphagia and morbid obesity. In patients with genetic leptin deficiency, therapy with exogenous leptin effectively suppresses hyperphagia and corrects metabolic and other abnormalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. However, in most cases of obesity levels of circulating leptin are high, implying a state of resistance to the weight-reducing effect of leptin. Consequently, clinical trials using recombinant leptin for the pharmacological treatment of obesity yielded disappointing results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Leptin resistance in rodents can be induced by short-term voluntary overfeeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], by feeding high-fat diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and by chronically elevated leptin levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Reduced leptin sensitivity is also a physiological mechanism to allow anticipatory energy intake and storage of nutrients, <italic>e.g</italic>. during pregnancy or in hibernators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Mechanisms of leptin resistance include failure of circulating leptin to reach its targets in the brain, inhibition of the intracellular leptin signaling cascade, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and antagonism of the physiological actions of leptin downstream from the primary target cell of leptin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Regardless of the relative contributions of these mechanisms, it is clear that the ability of leptin to activate intracellular signaling pathways is decreased by high chronic blood levels of leptin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. However, the mechanisms underlying the leptin-induced state of reduced leptin sensitivity are not yet understood at the molecular level.</p><p>The leptin receptor belongs to the cytokine receptor superfamily and exists in several splicing variants. Leptin binding to the long leptin receptor isoform (LEPRb) activates cytokine-like signal transduction <italic>via </italic>the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway. Leptin stimulation leads to the activation of JAKs that are constitutively associated with LEPRb and in turn phosphorylate tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain of the receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The phosphorylated tyrosines (pTyr) provide docking sites for proteins with Src homology 2 (SH2) domains. pTyr985 (numbering refers to the sequence of murine LEPRb) recruits the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, which mediates the activation of the RAS/RAF/ERK pathway, whereas the STAT proteins bind to pTyr1077 (STAT5) and pTyr1138 (STAT1, STAT3 and STAT5) (for recent reviews see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]). The bound STAT factors are phosphorylated by the receptor-associated JAK kinases, dimerize and translocate to the nucleus to control transcription of specific target genes. LEPRb-induced STAT3 activation is essential for leptin regulation of energy balance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Although SHP2 has tyrosine phosphatase activity, its overexpression or knockdown only marginally alters the levels of leptin-induced STAT3 phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Multiple studies support roles for two inhibitory proteins, suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) and protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), as negative regulators of leptin signaling. The level of PTP1B expression modulates LEPRb signaling in cell lines and <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], and its upregulation by leptin implies a function as a negative feedback regulator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the upregulation of SOCS3 by leptin contributes to the attenuation of LEPRb signaling <italic>in vivo </italic>and in cultured cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. SOCS3 suppresses cytokine signaling by inhibiting the receptor-associated JAK kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] or by targeting bound signaling proteins for proteasomal degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Optimal inhibition of JAKs occurs when SOCS3 is recruited to cytokine receptor complexes <italic>via </italic>binding to specific phosphotyrosine motifs (pTyr759 in gp130, pTyr985 in LEPRb, pTyr401 in the erythropoietin receptor, pTyr800 in the IL-12R&#x003b2;2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. SOCS1 is structurally similar to SOCS3 and is generally thought to inhibit JAKs by direct binding to the activation loop of the kinase, independent of receptor-tyrosine motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>Numerous studies have implicated the intracellular tyrosine residues of LEPRb in the negative regulation of leptin signaling. Tyr1138 is essential for the STAT3-dependent upregulation of the feedback inhibitor SOCS3 in response to leptin stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], and the mutation of Tyr1138 prevented the attenuation of ERK activation during prolonged leptin stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Moreover, the phenotype of knock-in mice expressing a LEPRb mutant for Tyr1138 provides evidence of increased effects of leptin that are independent of STAT3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. No clear picture has yet emerged concerning the roles of Tyr985 and Tyr1077 in the attenuation of LEPRb signaling. Bj&#x000f8;rbaek <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] demonstrated that SOCS3 inhibits leptin signaling <italic>via </italic>binding to pTyr985, but the attenuation of LEPRb-induced ERK activation was later shown to occur independently of Tyr985 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Tyr1077 was only recently established as an <italic>in vivo</italic>-phosphorylation site of LEPRb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] although its possible role as recruitment site for SOCS3 has already been suggested in an earlier study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. In addition to the unresolved contribution of Tyr985 and Tyr1077 in the negative regulation of leptin signaling, the molecular mechanisms by which SOCS3 inhibits LEPRb under chronic stimulation remain poorly characterized.</p><p>In the present study we analyzed the molecular mechanisms of attenuation of leptin signaling under conditions of continuous stimulation. In particular, we focused on the contribution of the intracellular tyrosine residues in LEPRb and their interaction with SOCS1 and SOCS3. We found that the presence of one of the two proximal intracellular tyrosine residues (Tyr985 or Tyr1077) was sufficient for the attenuation of STAT3 activation, and that either tyrosine residue can support the suppression of LEPRb signaling by SOCS3. Finally, we show that the receptor-associated JAK kinase has reduced STAT-phosphorylating activity after two hours of continuous receptor stimulation. However, the kinase is not dephosphorylated or degraded, and the inhibition of activity depends on the presence of Tyr985 and Tyr1077 in LEPRb.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Attenuation of leptin-induced STAT3 activation depends on the presence of either Tyr985 or Tyr1077</title><p>To examine the role of Tyr985 and Tyr1077 in the attenuation of LEPRb signaling during prolonged ligand stimulation, we determined the kinetics of leptin-induced STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation in RINm5F cells. We have previously established the insulinoma cell line RINm5F as a model system to define the differential effects of the intracellular tyrosines in LEPRb signal transduction and their effects on gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. We used RINm5F subclones expressing wild type (WT) LEPRb or mutant receptor construct in which one or both of these tyrosines were mutated to phenylalanine. The presence of Tyr1138 in the mutant receptors allowed us to monitor STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation as the principle downstream signaling event. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, continuous treatment of RINm5F-LEPRb-WT cells with leptin resulted in a maximal tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 from 15 - 75 min, after which the level of the phosphorylated STAT3 declined sharply but remained detectable at reduced levels for 3 h. Mutation of neither Tyr985 nor Tyr1077 in LEPRb-FYY and LEPRb-YFY abrogated the attenuation of LEPRb signaling. STAT3 activation by the LEPRb double mutant lacking both Tyr985 and Tyr1077 (LEPRb-FFY) did not decline during the 4-h treatment with leptin. Similar time courses of STAT3 phosphorylation were observed in HIT-T15 cells transiently expressing wild type and mutant LEPRb constructs (see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: supplementary Figure S1).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Time course of STAT3 activation by LEPRb tyrosine/phenylalanine mutants</bold>. <bold>A</bold>, Schematic representation of the LEPRb point mutants used in this study.

After 2 h of leptin treatment, binding assays showed only a weakly reduced leptin binding to the cell surface, which could not account for the reduced STAT3 phosphorylation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Next we used the transcriptional inhibitor, actinomycin D, to reveal whether active gene expression was required for feedback inhibition. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, treatment with actinomycin D prevented the decrease of leptin-induced STAT3 phosphorylation over time. A similar result was obtained by treatment with cycloheximide (10 &#x003bc;g/ml; data not shown). These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that LEPRb signaling in RINm5F cells is attenuated by the upregulation of SOCS family proteins. Therefore, we examined whether leptin induced the expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3 in RINm5F cells. As previously observed in other cell lines (CHO, PC12, and 32D, rat skeletal muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]), leptin induced a rapid upregulation of SOCS3 mRNA levels within 1 h but did not affect the expression of SOCS1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). However, SOCS1 mRNA was upregulated in response to IL-1&#x003b2; or the simultaneous application of leptin and IL-1&#x003b2;. We tested this combination of cytokines because we had previously shown that IL-1&#x003b2; enhanced the expression of several leptin-induced genes in RINm5F cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. In contrast to a previous study in RINm5F cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], we observed no upregulation of SOCS3 mRNA by IL-1&#x003b2;. Consistent with previous reports that the transcription of the SOCS3 gene is regulated by STAT3, Tyr1138 was sufficient for the induction of SOCS3 expression in RINm5F cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Thus, the LEPRb constructs used throughout this study were fully capable of inducing the expression of SOCS3.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Attenuation of LEPRb signaling is not due to receptor internalization and depends on active gene expression</bold>. <bold>A</bold>, Binding of leptin-SEAP to RINm5F cells stably expressing LEPRb was determined after cells were treated with leptin (20 ng/nl) for 2 h or were not treated (Ctrl).

As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, mutation of Tyr985 (LEPRb-FYY) caused a twofold increase of leptin-induced reporter gene activity, consistent with the known function of this tyrosine as a docking site for SOCS3. Significantly higher luciferase activity was induced by the mutant receptor lacking both Tyr985 and Tyr1077 (FFY), indicating that Tyr1077 also plays a role in the negative regulation of LEPRb&#x02192;STAT3 signaling.

In contrast, LEPRb-FFY was largely resistant to SOCS3 overexpression and was only weakly inhibited by the highest expression levels of SOCS3. This result provides evidence that SOCS3 inhibits LEPRb signaling not only by binding to Tyr985 but also to Tyr1077. A similar result was obtained in the hamster insulinoma cell line HIT-T15, although LEPRb-FYY and LEPRb-FFY differed in their sensitivity to SOCS3 only at higher expression levels (see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: supplementary Figure S2A).</p><p>Overexpressed SOCS1 inhibited wild type LEPRb as efficiently as SOCS3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>).

Endogenous SOCS3 accumulated to higher levels after stimulation of LEPRb-FFY than LEPRb-FYY, confirming that Tyr1077 contributes to the negative regulation of the effects of leptin on gene expression. Expression of a SOCS3-directed shRNA reduced the expression of leptin-induced SOCS3 below the limits of detection (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Promoter activation by wild type LEPRb was enhanced 5-fold by knockdown of SOCS3 expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>), indicating that the negative feedback through SOCS3 plays a critical role in the modulation of the leptin response in HepG2 cells. Promoter activation by LEPRb-FYY was also significantly enhanced by knockdown of SOCS3, indicating that Tyr985 is not essential for the inhibitory effect of SOCS3. In contrast, the activity of LEPRb-FFY was not altered by the knockdown plasmid, suggesting that Tyr1077 must be responsible for the inhibitory effect of SOCS3 on LEPRb-FYY. Knockdown of SOCS1 expression increased LEPRb-induced promoter activity only by approximately 50% (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>) since SOCS1 is not induced by leptin (see above, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).

Surprisingly, the phosphorylation of the tyrosines in the activation loop of JAK2 (Tyr1007/1008) was not reduced at this time point, and no difference in JAK phosphorylation between WT and mutant LEPRb was observed. However, STAT1-phosphorylating activity of the WT LEPRb complex was markedly reduced after 2 h leptin treatment. In contrast, kinase activity remained constant in the LEPRb-FFY complexes. This result suggests that i) LEPRb signaling during chronic receptor stimulation is downregulated at the level of JAK activity, ii) kinase activity does not correlate with the phosphorylation of the tyrosines in the activation loop of the receptor-associated JAK kinase, and iii) the downregulation of leptin signaling depends on the presence of Tyr985 and/or Tyr1077 in LEPRb.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Assay of JAK2 activity in LEPRb complexes</bold>. <bold>A</bold>, Outline of the method. - RINm5F cells stably expressing WT or mutant (FFY) LEPRb were treated with leptin (20 ng/ml) for the 15 min or 120 min as indicated.

In two independent experiments, STAT1 phosphorylation by LEPRb-WT complexes was reduced by 57.3% and 42.6% after 2 h of leptin treatment, whereas the STAT1 phosphorylating activity of LEPRb-FFY complexes remained constant (103.1% and 111.3%).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2091-11-2-6"/></fig></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study we have deciphered the roles of the intracellular tyrosines for the attenuation of LEPRb signaling, in particular for the inhibitory effects of SOCS3 and SOCS1, and provide new evidence regarding the mechanism by which LEPRb signaling is terminated during chronic stimulation.</p><sec><title>Role of Tyr1077</title><p>We present a series of results documenting that Tyr1077 has a role in the negative regulation of LEPRb: (i) The presence of either Tyr985 or Tyr1077 in the cytoplasmic domain of LEPRb is sufficient for the attenuation of leptin-induced STAT3 phosphorylation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). (ii) LEPRb-FFY induces significantly higher reporter gene activity in HepG2 cells than LEPRb-FYY (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), suggesting that Tyr1077 contributes to negative regulation of leptin-induced gene expression. A similar effect has been observed in the neuronal PC12 cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] but neither in Hek293 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] nor our previous study of HIT-T15 insulinoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. The cell type specificity may be due to varying expression levels of other signaling molecules that compete for binding to pTyr1077, such as STAT5, SOCS2 or CIS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. (iii) The inhibitory effect of SOCS3 was reduced but still clearly present in the absence of Tyr985 (LEPRb-FYY), whereas the mutation of both Tyr985 and Tyr1077 (LEPRb-FFY) rendered LEPRb largely resistant to the inhibitory effect of SOCS3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). This result contrasts with that of Bj&#x000f8;rbaek <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], which suggested that overexpressed SOCS3 failed to inhibit STAT3-dependent reporter gene activity mediated by a Tyr985 mutant LEPRb construct. This difference may be attributed to the use of erythropoietin receptor-LEPRb chimeras in that study, or more likely, to the different cell systems used. Consistent with the results obtained in 293 cells by Bj&#x000f8;rbaek <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], we show that SOCS3 inhibited LEPRb-FYY in HIT-T15 cells only at the highest levels of expression (see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: supplementary Figure S2). (iv) The knockdown experiments show clearly that endogenous levels of SOCS3 are sufficient for the inhibition of LEPRb&#x02192;STAT3 signaling <italic>via </italic>pTyr1077 in HepG2 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Whereas reporter gene activity stimulated by LEPRb-FYY was significantly enhanced by knockdown of SOCS3, this was not the case for the double mutant (LEPRb-FFY). Thus, the inhibitory effect of endogenous SOCS3 is strictly dependent on the presence of either Tyr985 or Tyr1077. (v) Finally, LEPRb-FFY induced higher levels of SOCS3 than LEPRb-FYY (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>), confirming that the enhanced STAT3 activation translates into increased expression of an endogenous gene, not just the exogenous reporter construct.</p><p>Taken together, these results establish a role of pTyr1077 in the negative regulation of the LEPRb receptor complex, thus extending the prevailing view that Tyr985 is critical for the negative feedback regulation of leptin signaling. De Souza <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] have determined affinities of 8.3 &#x003bc;M and 26 &#x003bc;M for the binding of SOCS3 to phosphopeptides corresponding to regions surrounding and Tyr985 and Tyr1077 of LEPRb. Binding to pTyr1077 in LEPRb was thus somewhat weaker than to pTyr985, much weaker than to pTyr759 in the gp130 receptor (0.1 &#x003bc;M), but stronger than to the SOCS3 binding site of the erythropoietin receptor (pTyr425, 69 &#x003bc;M).</p><p>The capacity of Tyr1077 to substitute for the mutated Tyr985 provides an explanation for the Tyr985-independent attenuation of leptin signaling observed by Dunn <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Furthermore, this role for Tyr1077 may also explain why mice homozygous for a knock-in mutation of Tyr985 LEPRb display a relatively weak phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], as compared to mice with the corresponding mutation in the IL-6 cytokine family receptor signaling subunit glycoprotein 130 (gp130). The disruption of the negative feedback on gp130-dependent STAT signaling causes STAT3 hyperactivation, and these mice develop a broad spectrum of hematopoietic abnormalities, including splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, thrombocytosis and autoimmune arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. In contrast, although homozygous <italic>Lepr</italic><sup><italic>Leu985 </italic></sup>mice display a phenotype of increased leptin sensitivity, the effect of this mutation was only significant in females and under conditions of high fat diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. This mild phenotype is likely due to the negative feedback regulation through Tyr1077, which partially compensates for the mutation of Tyr985.</p></sec><sec><title>SOCS1 inhibits LEPRb signaling</title><p>We have shown by direct comparisons that SOCS1 inhibits LEPRb&#x02192;STAT3 signaling as potently as SOCS3. Furthermore, our results challenge the prevailing view that SOCS1 inhibits JAK kinases by directly binding to the activation loop, independent of receptor phosphotyrosine motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Even at low expression levels, SOCS1 inhibited wild type LEPRb more efficiently than LEPRb-FYY and LEPRb-FFY (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). This is not the first report that SOCS1 requires binding to a receptor chain tyrosine for its inhibitory effect. The inhibition of interferon-&#x003b3; signaling by SOCS1 has been shown to depend strictly on the presence of Tyr441 in the interferon-&#x003b3; receptor subunit 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. A similar observation has been reported for the G-CSF receptor in which Tyr729 is required for the inhibitory action of both SOCS1 and SOCS3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. This result was challenged by a later study in which only the inhibitory effect of SOCS3 but not SOCS1 depended on the presence of Tyr729 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. However, these seemingly conflicting data may be attributed to the different cell types used and/or to varying levels of SOCS overexpression. Because high levels of protein expression can conceal potential differences in the avidity of binding sites, we took care to study the effects of the SOCS proteins on LEPRb at expression levels that cause only partial inhibition of reporter gene activity. We conclude from our data that the inhibitory effect of SOCS1 on LEPRb in HepG2 cells is strongly enhanced by the presence of the Tyr985 phosphotyrosine motif. SOCS1 is less dependent than SOCS3 on this binding site (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), consistent with the higher affinity of JAK2 for the SOCS1 <italic>vs</italic>. SOCS3 SH2 domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Notably, the requirement of docking sites for the actions of SOCS1 and SOCS3 may differ between different cytokine receptors. A recent study has revealed that the feedback inhibition of the oncostatin M receptor by SOCS3 was independent of phosphotyrosine motifs in the receptor chain, whereas the same levels SOCS3 did not inhibit gp130 in the absence of Tyr759 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Hence, differences in requirement of recruitment sites, in addition to differences in the induction by various cytokines and different kinetics of induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>], critically determine the modulatory effects of SOCS1 and SOCS3 on cytokine receptor signaling. Further analyses will be necessary to characterize the binding of SOCS1 to pTyr985 and reveal the physiological consequence of this interaction for the function of LEPRb.</p><p>The inhibitory effect of SOCS1 on LEPRb signaling has not previously been analyzed as a mechanism of leptin resistance, because leptin does not induce expression of SOCS1 ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> of the present study). However, SOCS1 may inhibit LEPRb as a consequence of crosstalk between signaling pathways (<italic>e.g</italic>. IL-1&#x003b2; or IFN&#x003b3;) rather than as a feedback mechanism. Interestingly, SOCS1 has been reported to be upregulated in adipose tissue in two different models of obesity associated with leptin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. In the arcuate nucleus, steroid hormone dependent upregulation of SOCS1 contributes to prolactin resistance in late pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>], and may also contribute to the reduced leptin responsiveness in pregnancy. It remains to be determined whether upregulation of SOCS1 by other pathways plays a part in central or peripheral leptin resistance.</p></sec><sec><title>JAK inhibition</title><p>Cytokine receptors are subject to downregulation by a variety of mechanisms, such as internalization, dephosphorylation and degradation. Here we have focused on the mechanism by which STAT activation through LEPRb is quickly attenuated within two hours of continuous leptin stimulation. As previously observed in CHO cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], LEPRb surface expression was not significantly reduced after two hours (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). This result is consistent with the previous observation that presence or the absence of leptin did not alter the internalization rate of LEPRb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. Therefore, we asked whether the STAT phosphorylating activity of the receptor complex was altered after two hours of leptin treatment. Indeed, we observed markedly reduced activity of the JAK kinase associated with wild type LEPRb but not LEPRb-FFY. Our experimental approach allowed us to exclude several other potential mechanisms of receptor inactivation. (i) The receptor-associated JAK molecules were not dephosphorylated at this time point, excluding the possibility that tyrosine phosphatases, in particular PTP1B or SHP-2, are responsible for the fast inactivation of the JAK kinases. This result implies that the phosphorylation state of the JAKs is not a reliable measure of the catalytic activity, at least when the inactivation kinetics is concerned. (ii) The fact that the amounts of the receptor chain and the JAK kinase were not reduced after 2 h of leptin treatment suggests that the attenuation of LEPRb signaling is not a consequence of SOCS- triggered degradation of the receptor or the associated kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Moreover, termination of STAT phosphorylation is not caused by the dissociation of the JAK molecules from the receptor complex, a mechanism previously described for the receptors for erythropoietin, thrombopoietin and growth hormone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. (iii) The direct measurement of the reduced JAK activity in the isolated receptor complex excludes the possibility that the decrease of STAT tyrosine phosphorylation is exclusively determined by the rate of STAT dephosphorylation (<italic>e.g</italic>. by TC-PTP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]). The dephosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 must occur rapidly to allow for the fast termination of leptin signaling, but the downregulation of JAK activity is required to achieve the net reduction of STAT tyrosine phosphorylation and activation.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Taken together, we conclude from the available evidence and our present results that the first step in the attenuation of LEPRb&#x02192;STAT3 signaling in cells chronically stimulated by leptin occurs through the fast upregulation of the negative feedback regulator SOCS3. SOCS3 is recruited to either pTyr985 or pTyr1077 in the receptor chain and inhibits the receptor-associated JAK molecules by direct interaction of its kinase inhibitory region (KIR) with the activation loop of the kinase. The next step is putatively the dephosphorylation of the JAK molecules and/or the receptor, which is a fast event in some cell systems (<italic>e.g</italic>. Hek293 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]) but was separable from the initial inhibition of JAK activity in our experiments. Other mechanisms of negative regulation may play a role at later stages and contribute to the state of reduced leptin responsiveness induced by chronic leptin stimulation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cytokines and antibodies</title><p>Recombinant murine leptin was purchased from PeproTech (London, UK) and recombinant human IL-1&#x003b2; from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany).
