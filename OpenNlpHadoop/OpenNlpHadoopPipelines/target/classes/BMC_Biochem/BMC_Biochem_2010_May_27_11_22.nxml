In yeast, where it was first described, the cytoplasmic exosome comprises ten subunits, whereas the nuclear exosome is formed by eleven subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Eight subunits show sequence similarity to exoribonucleases, and for some of them catalytic activity was demonstrated <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Recent data indicate, however, that only the subunits Rrp6p and Rrp44p have intrinsic catalytic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In yeast, depletion of individual exosome subunits leads to similar phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], indicating that only the intact complex is functional <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Analyses of intra-complex interactions have provided the initial information on the yeast exosome architecture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. A working model for its structure and composition has been proposed based on mass spectrometry analyses of complexes purified under different conditions and on yeast two-hybrid interaction analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. According to this model, the RNA binding subunits (Rrp4p, Rrp40p and Csl4p) bind to one side of the RNase PH ring, which is formed by Rrp41p-Rrp45p-Rrp46p-Rrp43p-Mtr3p-Rrp42p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], whereas the hydrolytic RNases (Rrp44p and Rrp6p) bind to the opposite side of the ring, although Rrp44p, the largest exosome subunit, may also interact with Rrp4p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The crystal structure of the core human exosome has been recently determined, confirming the predictions for the structure of the eukaryotic complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>The archaeal exosome is composed of four different subunits, two RNA binding subunits, aCsl4 and aRrp4, and two subunits containing RNase PH domains, aRrp41 and aRrp42 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Three copies of an aRrp41-aRrp42 heterodimer form the RNase PH ring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], which associates with three molecules of aRrp4 and/or aCsl4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The RNase PH ring has three active sites, responsible for the phosphorolytic RNase activity of the complex, formed in the interface between aRrp41 and aRrp42 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. aCsl4 and aRrp4 may have a flexible structure, which allows them to interact with RNA and bring it to the central pore of the RNase PH ring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and, subsequently, to the active site. Despite having three active sites, the narrow entry pore of the exosome allows the passage of only one single-stranded RNA molecule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>In eukaryotes, the exosome associates with specific protein cofactors in both cellular compartments. In the nucleus, the exosome has been shown to interact with Rrp47p, Mtr4p, the TRAMP complex, and Nop53p, and in the cytoplasm, with the Ski complex [[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]]. Rrp47p has been proposed to be a nuclear exosome cofactor required for the processing of stable RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Nop53p is a nucleolar protein that activates the exosome during processing of pre-rRNA 7S to mature 5.8S rRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Mtr4p is an RNA helicase and is a subunit of the TRAMP complex, which is involved in RNA polyadenylation, directing the RNA for degradation by the exosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The Ski complex also contains a subunit with helicase activity, Ski2p, and is associated with the exosome in mRNA degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The different protein cofactors that associate with the exosome may regulate its function.</p><p>Although the archaeal exosome has been shown to associate with other proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], little is known about archaeal exosome cofactors or regulatory proteins. There are, however, some plausible candidates for exosome regulatory factors. Among them, PaSBDS, a protein encoded by a gene found in the <italic>Pyrococcus abyssi </italic>exosome operon, of which eukaryotic orthologues (Sdo1p in yeast, SBDS in human and in <italic>Trypanosoma</italic>) have been shown to be involved in ribosome maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. PaNip7 has been shown to bind RNA <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] and its yeast orthologue, Nip7p, is involved in rRNA processing and interacts with the yeast exosome subunit Rrp43p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], corroborating the hypothesis of PaNip7 being a Pa-exosome cofactor. Pa1135 is a protein of unknown function, encoded by a gene found in the same operon as the RNase P subunit Rrp30 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], and may also be involved in RNA processing. In this work, we show that PaSBDS and PaNip7 affect the exosome activity. PaSBDS competes with the exosome for binding to poly-A RNA, thereby slightly inhibiting its degradation by the complex. PaNip7 binds preferentially to U- and AU-rich RNAs, and strongly inhibits the exosome due to its association with both the exosome complex and the substrate RNA. Pa1135 on the other hand, though also binding U- and AU-rich RNAs in vitro, does not inhibit RNA degradation by the exosome. These findings indicate that PaNip7p and PaSBDS may be exosome regulatory factors. This is the first example of archaeal proteins regulating the exosome by inhibition.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Pa-exosome complexes show different affinities for binding to oligo-RNA in vitro</title><p>The archaeal exosome complex is composed of the RNase PH ring (containing three aRrp41-aRrp42 heterodimers) and three molecules of the RNA binding subunits aRrp4 (aRrp4-exosome), or aCsl4 (aCsl4-exosome), or a mixture of both. The archaeal exosome has been shown to bind poly-A RNA, when incubated in the absence of phosphate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Interestingly, the RNase PH ring subcomplex (apo-exosome) is able to bind RNA by itself in the absence of the RNA binding subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. We had previously reconstituted the <italic>Pyrococcus </italic>exosome <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], by assembling PhRrp41 and PhRrp42 (from <italic>P. horikoshii</italic>) and PaRrp4p (from <italic>P. abyssi</italic>). In this work, the same approach was used to reconstitute the <italic>P. abyssi </italic>exosome, containing PaRrp41, PaRrp42, and either PaRrp4 or PaCsl4. We first compared the RNA binding ability of the <italic>in vitro </italic>assembled <italic>P. abyssi </italic>apo-exosome, here designated as RNase PH ring, and the holo-exosomes PaRrp4-exosome, and PaCsl4-exosome through EMSA. The results show that upon addition of increasing amounts of the exosome complexes (1, 10 or 20 pmol) to a poly-A RNA, the free RNA band decreases, while bands appear in the upper part of the gel, which correspond to RNP complexes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The PaRrp4-exosome binds poly-rA three-fold more efficiently than the RNase PH ring, and nine-fold more efficiently than the PaCsl4-exosome (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, lanes 4-12). This difference in RNA affinity is probably due to the presence of the two RNA binding domains S1 and KH in PaRrp4, and confirms our previous observation of more efficient RNA binding by the <italic>Pyrococcus horikoshii-abysii </italic>assembled complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Interestingly, although PaCsl4 contains the RNA binding domains S1 domain and Zn-ribbon, we observed a less efficient binding of the PaCsl4-exosome to RNA than the apo-exosome (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>; compare lanes 4-6 to 10-12). Incubation of the RNase PH ring with poly-rA resulted in the formation of an RNA-protein complex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), but also in some degradation of the RNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>; lanes 4-6). Since no phosphate was added to these reactions, degradation products might be due to residual phosphate present in the protein fractions. It is unlikely that this RNase activity is due to contaminant <italic>E. coli </italic>RNases co-purified with the exosome RNase PH ring, because <italic>E. coli </italic>extracts were incubated at 80&#x000b0;C for 30 minutes immediately before purification of the archaeal proteins. Similar residual phosphorolytic activities were reported for <italic>Sulfolobus solfataricus </italic>RNase PH ring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Incubation of the PaRrp4-exosome with poly-rA resulted in the formation of RNA-exosome complexes of different sizes, resulting in the detection of RNA shifted bands and to some complexes that were retained in the gel slot (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). These larger complexes might result from binding of various exosome molecules to the same RNA, or from protein precipitation at higher concentrations, and were not included in the quantitative analyses of the experiments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B-D</xref>). These assays were performed at least three times, with different protein preparations and probes, and here a representative experiment is shown.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Influence of putative cofactors on Pa-exosome poly-A RNA binding</bold>.

In order to obtain insights into the association of the archaeal exosome with other proteins that are expected to function in RNA processing, a series of experiments were performed with three candidate proteins, PaSBDS, PaNip7, and Pa1135. PaSBDS does not bind poly-rC, binds poly-rU with low affinity, binds 10 nucleotides long poly-rA, but more efficiently longer poly-rA, and binds poly-rAU RNAs (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> Figure S1A). PaNip7, has already been shown to bind RNA <italic>in vitro </italic>with higher affinity for U-rich RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], and here we show that PaNip7 also binds a poly-AU RNA (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> Figure S1B) that contains complementary sequence and can form both intra- and inter-strand base-pairs. Similar to PaNip7 and PaSBDS, Pa1135 binds poly-AU RNA very efficiently, but differently from PaNip7 and PaSBDS, it does not bind to any of the RNA homopolymers tested (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> Figure S1C).</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of <italic>P. abyssi </italic>proteins on the exosome-RNA interaction</title><p>Consistent with the results described above, parallel EMSA with Pa1135, PaNip7 and PaSBDS and a poly-rA substrate showed that a band shift can be detected only for PaSBDS (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, lanes 2, 3, and 26, respectively). Incubation of the exosome complexes with RNA in the presence of these proteins revealed their effect on the exosome RNA binding activity. As shown here, although Pa1135 does not bind poly-rA, it inhibits 1.6-fold poly-rA binding by RNase PH ring and 1.7-fold binding by PaCsl4-exosome (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B, D</xref>). However, Pa1135 does not show a pronounced effect on the PaRrp4-exosome binding to poly-rA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, lanes 13-15; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Since the exosome has a much higher affinity for binding to poly-rA than PaNip7, in a direct competition assay the exosome was expected to prevail over PaNip7 for poly-rA binding. Instead, the results show a strong decrease in the intensity of the bands shifted by the exosome in the presence of PaNip7 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, lanes 16-24). PaNip7 caused a three-fold decrease in poly-rA binding by the RNase PH ring, a 40-fold decrease in binding by the PaRrp4-exosome, and a 20-fold decrease in binding by the PaCsl4-exosome. This result indicates that the decrease in the exosome binding to poly-rA caused by PaNip7 may be due to a direct interaction between PaNip7 and the exosome and not to direct competition for binding to poly-rA.</p><p>PaSBDS, on the other hand, binds poly-rA, and was expected to compete with the exosome for binding to this RNA. When PaSBDS and the exosome complexes are incubated with poly-rA, the band corresponding to the free RNA decreases in intensity and bands corresponding to PaSBDS-RNA and exosome-RNA become visible (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, lanes 27-35). Poly-rA binding by PaRrp4-exosome was little affected by the presence of PaSBDS, indicating that PaRrp4-exosome has higher affinity for poly-rA than PaSBDS (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, lanes 30-32; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). The observation that PaSBDS-RNA complex results in a smear, instead of a well defined band, also indicates a low stability complex. Surprisingly, however, RNase PH ring and PaCsl4-exosome bound poly-rA more efficiently upon addition of PaSBDS (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, lanes 27-29 and 33-35, respectively). In summary, PaSBDS binds poly-rA and increases RNA binding by the RNase PH ring and the PaCsl4-exosome, but does not strongly affect the PaRrp4-exosome. Pa1135 and PaNip7, do not bind poly-rA with high affinity, but affect the exosome. Pa1135 affects RNA binding by the exosome complexes with lower RNA affinity, RNase PH ring and PaCsl4-exosome, while not affecting the PaRrp4-exosome, which has higher affinity for RNA. PaNip7 inhibits all the exosome complexes, and more strongly PaRrp4-exosome and PaCsl4-exosome.</p></sec><sec><title>PaNip7 and PaSBDS interfere with exosome RNA degradation</title><p>The archaeal exosome has been shown to degrade RNA <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], and based on the effect of PaNip7, PaSBDS, or Pa1135 on the exosome RNA binding, we decided to investigate whether the RNase activity of the complex was also influenced by these proteins. RNA degradation assays were performed in the presence of Tris-50 buffer and 10 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4 </sub>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Upon addition of 100 pmol Pa1135 to the reaction, little effect was detected on the degradation of a 14-nucleotide poly-rA substrate by RNase PH ring and PaCsl4-exosome, and higher inhibition was detected on PaRrp4-exosome (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, lanes 13-15; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B-D</xref>). 100 pmol PaNip7, on the other hand, inhibited the RNase activity of all complexes, showing a stronger inhibitory effect on the holo-exosome complexes, PaRrp4-exosome and PaCsl4-exosome (3.8- and 6.1-fold inhibition of the RNase activity, respectively) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>; compare lanes 4-12 to lanes 16-24). Addition of 200 pmol PaSBDS inhibited the RNase activity of the RNase PH ring and PaRrp4-exosome up to eight-fold (mainly in the reactions containing lower amounts of these exosome complexes), but showed little effect on the PaCsl4-exosome (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, lanes 27-35).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of the putative cofactors on Pa-exosome poly-A RNA degradation activity</bold>.

For this purpose, RNase protection assays were performed in the presence of 10 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, and samples were subjected to electrophoresis in native polyacrylamide gels. Under these conditions, it was possible to analyze both binding of the proteins to the poly-AU RNA, as well as RNA degradation by the exosome. In this experiment, we first incubated the poly-rAU with either buffer or PaNip7 for 30 minutes, after which time the exosome complexes and 10 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4 </sub>were added and the reactions were further incubated for 15 minutes. The three exosome complexes bound efficiently to the poly-rAU although this RNA can form base pairs of low stability. The bands of the free RNA probe are only visible in the reactions containing low amounts of the exosome complexes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>; lanes 2-10), indicating that the probe is bound and consequently degraded by the exosome. This finding indicates that all exosome complexes can degrade low stability double-stranded RNAs. Despite the ability of the exosome complexes to degrade the poly-rAU oligo, it was not as effective as the poly-rA degradation (compare Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Influence of PaNip7 on Pa-exosome RNA binding and degradation of poly-AU RNA</bold>.

When incubated with RNA in the presence of PaNip7, the RNase PH ring seems to degrade only the free RNA, and not the molecules bound to PaNip7, since the free RNA band decreases in intensity while the band corresponding to the degradation product increases, and the PaNip7-RNA band remains mostly unchanged (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, lanes 13-15). In the cases of PaRrp4- and PaCsl4-exosome, due to the presence of the RNA binding subunits, the holo-exosome complexes bind the RNA more efficiently than the RNase PH ring (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, lanes 2-10). Upon incubation of PaRrp4- and PaCsl4-exosome with poly-rAU bound to PaNip7, the free RNA band decreases in intensity while exosome-RNA complexes are detected and the band of degradation products becomes visible (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, lanes 16-21). It is interesting to note that in all cases, much less RNA is degraded in the presence of PaNip7 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, compare lanes 2-10 to lanes 13-21; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B-D</xref>).</p><p>Although the RNase PH ring is a hexameric complex, whereas PaNip7 is a monomeric protein, the bands formed in the presence of RNase PH ring and PaNip7 run as complexes of approximately the same size. One hypothesis to explain this observation is that it is possible that more than one molecule of PaNip7 bind the same RNA, thereby forming larger RNP complexes. We ruled out the possibility that some of the PaRrp41 and PaRrp42 molecules might not be associated in the form of the RNase PH ring and bound RNA in their monomeric forms because the PaRrp41-PaRrp42 complex was purified by using size exclusion chromatography, selecting for complexes corresponding to the RNase PH ring size (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref> Figure S2). Furthermore, this complex is active for RNA degradation, confirming that the RNase PH ring was reconstituted <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Pa-exosome inhibition by PaNip7 depends on its ability to bind RNA</title><p>PaNip7 shows strong inhibitory effect on exosome degradation of poly-rAU, indicating that inhibition depends, at least partially on the PaNip7 ability to bind RNA. In order to test this possibility, poly-AU RNA degradation assays were performed in the presence of PaNip7 mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The RNase PH ring degrades poly-rAU, but not very efficiently (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>; lanes 2 and 3), whereas as the PaRrp4-exosome degrades only a few nucleotides of the poly-rAU substrate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>; lanes 4 and 5). The PaCsl4-exosome, on the other hand, degrades completely the poly-rAU substrate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>; lanes 6 and 7). These results are consistent with the more stable binding of PaRrp4-exosome to RNA and with the formation of a more constricted RNA entry pore in this exosome complex that does not allow double-stranded RNA molecules to be degraded. In the presence of wild type PaNip7, poly-rAU degradation was strongly inhibited (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>; lanes 9-17). Interestingly, PaNip7<sup>R151A, R152A </sup>(mutant that does not bind RNA; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]) does not inhibit RNA degradation by the exosome (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>; compare lanes 2-7 to lanes 19-27). Accordingly, the mutant PaNip7<sup>K155A, K158A</sup>, which binds RNA with low affinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], causes an intermediate inhibition (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>; lanes 29-37). These results confirm that in the case of poly-rAU, inhibition of exosome function depends on PaNip7 ability to interact with the substrate RNA. An additional control to these experiments was performed, in which the effect of Pa1135 on the RNase activity of the exosome was analyzed. Similar to PaNip7, Pa1135 binds AU-rich RNAs (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> Figure S1), but contrary to PaNip7, Pa1135 does not inhibit the RNase activity of the exosome (data not shown), confirming the specificity of the PaNip7 effect.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of PaNip7 mutants on the Pa-exosome poly-AU RNA degradation activity</bold>.

This could be the case in situations where the exosome and PaNip7 are incubated with AU-rich substrates since PaNip7 binds this type of RNA. However, PaNip7 inhibits the exosome also when the substrate is a poly-rA. Attempts to detect the interaction between PaNip7 and Pa-exosome through co-purification of the complexes using gel-filtration assays and protein pull-down experiments have failed (data not shown). This raised the hypothesis that PaNip7 might have low affinity for the Pa-exosome, or the interaction PaNip7-exosome is transient. In order to determine whether PaNip7 could interact directly with the Pa-exosome, PaNip7 was labeled with FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate) and incubated with the exosome complexes for 30 minutes at 25&#x000b0;C. The resulting complexes were initially subjected to electrophoresis on native polyacrylamide gels followed by analysis of the fluorescence signal on an image plate reader. The results from these assays show that PaNip7 binds to the holo-exosome complexes, with a higher affinity for the PaCsl4-exosome than for the PaRrp4-exosome (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).

Furthermore, since very little is known of the possible archaeal exosome regulatory factors, here we analyzed the effects of three proteins on the exosome activities when degrading different substrates.</p><p>The nine-subunit PaRrp4-exosome binds RNA with higher affinity but degrades RNA less efficiently than PaCsl4-exosome. These different characteristics could be explained by PaRrp4 having higher affinity for RNA than PaCsl4, due to the presence of one S1 and one KH domain in PaRrp4, instead of one S1 and one zinc-ribbon domain in PaCsl4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Consequently, depending on the RNA binding subunit present in the complex, the structure of the exosome RNA entry pore may undergo conformational changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], leading to the different RNA binding affinities of the exosome complexes and the slower RNA degradation by the PaRrp4-exosome. Although the archaeal exosome binds the substrate RNA directly, it may also interact with various protein factors that are important for directing the complex to the substrate, for opening RNA secondary structures, and possibly for regulating its function.</p><p>The bacterial PNPase, which is structurally and functionally related to the exosome, is part of the degradosome, a protein complex involved in rRNA and tRNA processing and in mRNA degradation that is formed by PNPase, RNase E, the helicase RhlB, and enolase [reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]]. In eukaryotes, exosome co-factors include the helicase Mtr4p, the TRAMP complex, Nop53p, Dob1p, Rrp47p, Npl3p, Lsm proteins, the Ski complex, and the Nrd1p/Nab3p complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Yeast Nip7p has been shown to interact with the exosome subunit Rrp43p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Conditional depletion of yeast Nip7p leads to the accumulation of pre-rRNA 27S, a precursor of 5.8S and 25S rRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Nip7p interacts with RNA <italic>in vitro </italic>and with several proteins known to associate with the pre-rRNA 27S [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. The yeast and archaeal orthologues of Nip7 contain a PUA domain, which has been previously demonstrated to be involved in RNA interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Accordingly, Nip7p and PaNip7 bind RNA <italic>in vitro</italic>, with higher affinity for poly-U RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Here we show that PaNip7 also has high affinity for poly-AU RNAs that can form weak secondary structures. PaNip7 strongly inhibits the archaeal exosome, and this inhibition depends on PaNip7 ability to bind RNA and to interact with the exosome complex. Supporting this conclusion, PaNip7 mutants that do not bind RNA, have smaller inhibitory effects on the exosome. It is possible that PaNip7 binds RNA through its C-terminal PUA domain, and interacts with the archaeal exosome via its N-terminal domain, thereby controlling the exosome function. The hypothesis that the inhibition of the exosome by PaNip7 involves both RNA binding and protein interaction is further strengthened by the observations that PaNip7 also inhibits the degradation of RNAs for which PaNip7 has low affinity, such as poly-rA. Interestingly, PaNip7 has stronger inhibitory effect on PaCsl4-exosome, indicating a possible role for PaNip7 as a regulatory factor for one of the exosome complexes. PaNip7 could interact with PaCsl4 Zn-ribbon domain, which may be involved in the interaction with proteins, providing a mechanism for the exosome regulation.</p><p>Pa1135 was shown here to bind poly-rAU RNA but contrary to PaNip7 does not strongly affect the exosome RNase activity, although Pa1135 inhibits RNA binding by the RNase PH ring and PaCsl4-exosome complexes.
