The change in DNA topology is catalyzed via concerted breaking and rejoining of DNA coupled with DNA strand passage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], forming a covalent topoisomerase complex with cleaved DNA as the catalytic intermediate. The accumulation of the covalent complex accounts for the lethal effects of many topoisomerase inhibitors that are utilized as anticancer or antibacterial drugs in therapeutic applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. These drugs target type IB and type IIA topoisomerases, classified according to their structural and mechanistic properties. Discovery of similar topoisomerase poison inhibitors for type IA topoisomerases, which include bacterial topoisomerase I enzyme, could lead to the discovery of novel antibacterial agents that can be used for treatment of multi-drug resistant bacterial pathogens. It has been demonstrated via mutants defective in DNA rejoining that accumulation of <italic>E. coli </italic>or <italic>Yersinia pestis </italic>topoisomerase I cleavage complex in <italic>E. coli </italic>leads to rapid bacterial cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] validating bacterial topoisomerase I as a new therapeutic target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In addition to poison inhibitors, catalytic inhibitors that act by a different mechanism could also be useful therapeutic agents for bacterial pathogens that require a functional topoisomerase I enzyme for viability or pathogenicity. It has been suggested that at least one type IA topoisomerase enzyme activity must be present in each organism for resolving topological barriers that require single-stranded DNA cleavage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Unlike <italic>E. coli</italic>, which encodes topoisomerase III as a second type IA topoisomerase, <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>has only one type IA topoisomerase activity. Results from previous transposon mutagenesis studies strongly suggest that the topoisomerase I function is required for <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>growth and survival during infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>topoisomerase I (MtTOP1) has been proposed as a target for discovery of new TB drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] that are urgently needed due to the large number of human deaths caused by TB globally, and the increasing incidence of TB strains resistant to all available current drugs.</p><p>To study the structure-function of MtTOP1 and to monitor its activity, it would be desirable to have a rapid genetic assay for its specific function. The <italic>E. coli </italic>strain AS17 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] has a mutation in the chromosomal <italic>topA </italic>gene that reduces the topoisomerase I relaxation activity, with growth permissible at 30&#x000b0;C but non-permissive at 42&#x000b0;C unless complemented by recombinant relaxation activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The topoisomerase I enzyme of <italic>E. coli </italic>and <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>shares a highly homologous transesterification domain (~67,000 kDa) that is conserved among all type IA topoisomerases. It contains the active site tyrosine residue for nucleophilic attack of DNA in the formation of the covalent cleavage complex, and residues in the TOPRIM domain required for coordination of Mg<sup>2+ </sup>during catalysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. DNA cleavage site selectivity was found to involve the preference of a cytosine at the-4 position relative to the cleavage sites preferred by topoisomerase I and reverse gyrase enzymes in the type IA family of topoisomerases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, the transesterification domain cannot carry out relaxation of negative supercoils in the absence of the C-terminal domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The C-terminal domains of <italic>E. coli </italic>and <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>topoisomerase I belong to two distinct families. The C-terminal domain of <italic>E. coli </italic>topoisomerase I has multiple tetracysteine motifs for coordination of Zn(II) ions required for relaxation activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], while the C-terminal domains of topoisomerase I found in <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis </italic>and <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>were found not to have any Zn(II) coordinating tetracysteine motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>In addition to the difference between the C-terminal domain sequences of <italic>Mycobacterium </italic>and <italic>E. coli </italic>topoisomerase I, it is also unclear if MtTOP1 can be functional in <italic>E. coli </italic>due to the significant difference in codon usage between <italic>E. coli </italic>and <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. The structure-function study of MtTOP1 would be greatly facilitated if a rapid genetic assay system utilizing <italic>E. coli </italic>can be established. For further study of the enzymatic properties of MtTOP1, we have initiated biochemical studies of MtTOP1 to take advantage of the absence of cysteine residue in its sequence. If a unique cysteine can be introduced into a specific position via site-directed mutagenesis without diminishing the catalytic activity, spectroscopic or chemical probes can then be introduced to study the protein-DNA interactions involved in catalysis. Spectrophotometric analysis utilizing these probes could potentially be developed into HTS assay for identification and characterization of small molecule inhibitors of MtTOP1.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrated that plasmid encoding MtTOP1 can complement <italic>E. coli </italic>AS17 with temperature sensitive <italic>topA </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] for growth at 42&#x000b0;C. In addition to demonstrating that the relaxation activity of wild-type MtTOP1 was functional in <italic>E. coli</italic>, we also showed that when a mutant version of MtTOP1, with the G116 S TOPRIM mutation that inhibits DNA religation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] was overexpressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>, the SOS response is induced along with a significant decrease in viability. Therefore, the accumulation of cleavage complex formed by MtTOP1 can also be assayed in <italic>E. coli</italic>. We utilized the <italic>E. coli </italic>genetic system to identify a number of positions in MtTOP1 that could be mutated to cysteine with little or no loss of relaxation activity. The retention of relaxation activity was confirmed after the expression and purification of the mutant enzymes. One such cysteine substitution mutant enzyme MtTOP1-K524C was conjugated to a fluorescence dye for fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) study with fluorescence-labeled oligonucleotide substrates.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Complementation of <italic>topA </italic>function in <italic>E. coli </italic>AS17 for growth at 42&#x000b0;C by <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>topoisomerase I</title><p><italic>E. coli </italic>AS17 transformed with plasmid pMTOP was streaked onto LB plates with ampicillin and incubated at either 30&#x000b0;C or 42&#x000b0;C.

Complementation for growth at 42&#x000b0;C could be observed with both pMTOP and pETOP. No complementation for growth at 42&#x000b0;C could be seen with the vector pBAD/thio (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

Even though <italic>E. coli </italic>and <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>topoisomerase I enzymes have different C-terminal domain sequences, the conservation of the N-terminal transesterification domain in MtTOP1 is likely to allow MtTOP1 to bind to single-stranded DNA associated with negatively supercoiled region of the <italic>E. coli </italic>chromosome to remove excess negative supercoils.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Complementation of <italic>topA<sup>ts </sup></italic>function in <italic>E. coli </italic>AS17 by recombinant <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>topoisomerase I</bold>.

For recombinant <italic>E. coli </italic>or <italic>Y. pestis </italic>topoisomerase I, mutation of the first aspartate residue in the TOPRIM motif to asparagine has been shown to be extremely lethal to <italic>E. coli </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].

The Ser substitution was successfully made at Gly116 of the MtTOP1 TOPRIM motif in pMTOP and a clone with no second-site mutation was isolated in the presence of 2% glucose. The mutant MtTOP1-G116 S enzyme was expressed by arabinose induction and purified. Mg<sup>2+ </sup>ions are required for DNA religation and relaxation activity of all type IA topoisomerases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Mg<sup>2+ </sup>ions did not have to be added for DNA cleavage to be observed by wild-type MtTOP1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), but the DNA cleavage activity of MtTOP1-G116 S is Mg<sup>2+ </sup>dependent, similar to the Gly to Ser substitution mutants previously characterized for <italic>E. coli </italic>and <italic>Y. pestis </italic>topoisomerase I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Quantitation of the nicked DNA formed (additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Quantitation of DNA nicking by MtTOP1-G116S) showed that ~30% of the input DNA could be converted to the nicked form by MtTOP1-G116 S in the presence of MgCl<sub>2</sub>.

It is thus an ideal model system for biochemical studies where a unique cysteine can be introduced by site-directed mutagenesis to facilitate chemical conjugation of fluorescence or affinity probe at a specific position. Expression and purification procedures utilizing plasmid pLIC-MTOP have been developed to produce milligram quantities of soluble and active MtTOP1 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Even though the pLIC-MTOP plasmid requires induction of the T7 promoter for high level protein expression, there is likely to be a certain level of constitutive background expression in the absence of T7 RNA polymerase induction, similar to background expression of MtTOP1 from pMTOP in the absence of arabinose induction of the BAD promoter. This background expression in pLIC-MTOP was found to be sufficient for complementation of the <italic>topA </italic>function of <italic>E. coli </italic>AS17 for growth when plates incubated at 30&#x000b0;C and 42&#x000b0;C were compared (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Transformation of <italic>E. coli </italic>AS17 with the corresponding vector or plasmid expressing the active site mutant MtTOP1-Y342A did not result in complementation. A number of residues in MtTOP1 were selected for cysteine substitution based on the criteria that the residues are not highly conserved in identity, but are positioned near strictly conserved residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].

After labeling, the activity of the labeled enzyme was checked by relaxation activity assay. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, labeling with CPM did not affect the activity of the K524C mutant enzyme. The labeled MtTOP1-K524C demonstrated relaxation activity comparable to unlabeled MtTOP1-K524C. For the FRET experiments, a 35-base oligonucleotide substrate was designed to have a stem-loop structure providing the enzyme with both a single-stranded and a double-stranded region for potential interaction. This oligo was labeled with fluorescein at 3 positions: 3' end, 5' end and an internal location within the single-stranded loop. Upon titration of CPM-MtTOP1-K524C with substrate labeled with fluorescein at either the 5' or 3' end, no FRET was observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B, C</xref>). However, upon titration with substrate labeled with fluorescein in the single-stranded loop, a large drop in the CPM emission (470 nm) and a corresponding increase in the fluorescein emission (520 nm) indicated the occurrence of FRET (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). The results obtained from the FRET experiments were used to calculate the energy transfer efficiency (<italic>E</italic>).

The utilization of MtTOP1 as a potential new drug target would be facilitated by development of simple assays for the catalytic function of the enzyme. It is also desirable to identify poison inhibitors that can result in accumulation of the covalent complex of MtTOP1, since such topoisomerase poison inhibitors are expected to be bactericidal, and might be useful when used in combination therapy with current TB drugs such as fluoroquinolones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>The results described here demonstrated that inhibition of DNA religation by recombinant MtTOP1 would result in killing of the <italic>E. coli </italic>host cells. Increased expression of recombinant MtTOP1 should result in hypersensitivity to its poison inhibitors. The catalytic function of recombinant MtTOP1 could also be assessed easily from its complementation of the temperature sensitive <italic>topA </italic>function in <italic>E. coli </italic>AS17 at the non-permissive temperature. Despite a potential problem from difference in codon preference of the different organisms, and divergence of the topoisomerase I C-terminal domain sequences, recombinant MtTOP1 could still form covalent cleavage complex on the <italic>E. coli </italic>chromosome and remove excess negative supercoils so that viable functions can proceed.</p><p>The <italic>E. coli </italic>cell based assays are useful in structure-function studies of the enzyme. Mutations that abolish the catalytic activity after amino acid substitutions, such as Y342A and G116 S, could be identified readily. In another approach to study the enzyme mechanism, cysteine mutagenesis sites in different regions of the enzyme which do not affect the enzyme activity could also be determined rapidly by using the <italic>E. coli </italic>AS17 complementation assay. These cysteine substitutions are designed to take advantage of the absence of cysteine in wild-type MtTOP1 sequence to introduce a sulfhydryl group that would allow conjugation of a molecular probe at a unique position on the enzyme. Cysteine mutants that could complement AS17 for growth at non-permissive temperature were found to have close to wild-type relaxation activity when purified, confirming the effectiveness of the genetic assay.</p><p>For CPM fluorophore introduced at residue K524, FRET was observed with fluorescein fluorophore placed in the single stranded region of the substrate, but not at the double stranded region. In the mechanistic model proposed for the relaxation of DNA by topoisomerase I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], a single strand of DNA passes into the interior cavity of the enzyme in order to change the linking number of the DNA substrate. That would place the loop region of the single-stranded DNA in the vicinity of K524, accounting for FRET between CPM-MtTOP1-K524C and fluorescein in the single-stranded loop region of the substrate. The double-stranded region of the DNA substrate may extend from the DNA binding groove formed by subdomains I and IV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], further away from the interior cavity of the enzyme and K524, explaining the absence of FRET when fluorescein was placed at the 5' or 3' end of the DNA substrate. Although H139 is closer to the active site tyrosine Y342 than K524, binding of the stem region of the DNA substrate in subdomain IV would place the DNA in opposite direction from the active site away from H139, too far for FRET to take place. We tried to attach fluorescent probes with the Y174C mutant, but the labeling efficiency was poor. Other cysteine substitution mutants will be explored in future related mechanistic studies. Cysteine substitution mutants of MtTOP1 could potentially be utilized for development of enzyme based HTS assays for inhibitors of MtTOP1 activity.</p><p>The E. coli cell based assays could also be useful for testing potential MtTOP1 inhibitors. Whole cell screenings has identified a large number of small molecules that can inhibit the growth of <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], but it is often difficult to quickly determine the cellular target of antibacterial compounds without extensive follow up investigations. Previous studies showed that the <italic>topA </italic>function in <italic>E. coli </italic>AS17 can also be complemented by the type IB topoisomerase gene from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Since the type IA and type IB topoisomerases have distinctly different structures and mechanisms, an inhibitor with high specificity against type IA topoisomerase would affect growth of <italic>E. coli </italic>AS17 complemented by MtTOP1 activity at the non-permissive temperature, but should have much lower antibacterial activity against <italic>E. coli </italic>AS17 complemented by yeast topoisomerase I. This complementation assay system should facilitate the identification of lead compounds that have antibacterial activity due to interactions with <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>topoisomerase I in their mechanism of action. Toxic compounds that reduce cell viability by interaction with cell membranes or DNA can be eliminated quickly in the pursuit of useful drug leads. To facilitate the screening, permeability of <italic>E. coli </italic>AS17 to small molecules can be enhanced by incorporation of mutations that affect the drug transporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] or membrane structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Rapid genetic assays in <italic>E. coli </italic>have been described here for assessing the relaxation activity and accumulation of covalent cleavage complex of recombinant MtTOP1.
