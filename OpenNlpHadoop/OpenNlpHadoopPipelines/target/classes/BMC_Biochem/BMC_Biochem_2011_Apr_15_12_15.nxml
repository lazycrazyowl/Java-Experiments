After induction by TNF-&#x003b1;, elevated concentrations of several pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e. IL-6, IL-1&#x003b2;) and chemokines (i.e. IL-8) are released from airway epithelial cells. In order to reduce the excessive inflammatory response in the airways of CF patients, new therapies have been developed and in this respect, medicinal plant extracts have been studied.

In addition to its primary biological role, CFTR is likely to affect the expression of a number of gene products, including proteins of the signalling pathways of the inflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. One of the major problems of CF is a chronic inflammatory process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], leading to elevated concentrations of several pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e. IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;) and chemokines (i.e. IL-8), released from airway epithelial cells and found in the bronchoalveolar fluid of CF patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The lung inflammation is characterized by a sustained accumulation of neutrophils, high proteolytic activity and elevated levels of cytokines and chemokines, such as interleukin (IL)-8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Massive infiltration of neutrophils in airways, enhanced adherence of neutrophils to CF airway epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], elevated levels of cytokines and chemokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids such as IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], may contribute to an over exuberant pro-inflammatory response in lungs of patients with CF.</p><p>IL-8 is clearly involved in inflammatory processes associated with CF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].

Recently, there is a growing interest in developing therapies aimed at reducing the excessive inflammatory response in the airways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In this respect, extracts from plants used in ethnic medicine are of great interest, as many of them are known to present anti-inflammatory properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. For example, Darshan and Doreswamy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] described the anti-inflammatory activity of drugs derived from 38 medicinal plants. In this review a clear role of botanical plants (including polysaccharides, terpenes, curcuminoids and alkaloids) was reported as alleviating inflammatory diseases, such as arthritis, rheumatic pathologies, acne skin allergy and ulcers.</p><p>Bergamot (<italic>Citrus bergamia </italic>Risso) is a typical fruit of the Reggio Calabria province in Southern Italy, where it is mainly used for its essential oil extracted from the peel. Bergamot essential oil is widely used in the pharmaceutical industry because of the antibacterial and antiseptic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] of its volatile fraction, where the major component is the limonene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. However, bergamot peel contains also non-volatile components, such as coumarins and furanocoumarins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. This is not surprising, since furocoumarins and coumarins are generally distributed throughout the <italic>Citrus </italic>species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], being the highest amounts are found in <italic>Citrus </italic>peel oils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. These compounds are reported to have a broad spectrum of biological activities, including antimicrobial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], anti-platelet-aggregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], anti-mutagenic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] and anti-inflammatory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] activities.</p><p>In the present study, we analyzed the effects of bergamot extracts and their putative isolated compounds on the production of IL-8 in cystic fibrosis IB3-1 and CuFi-1 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] induced to hyper secretion of pro-inflammatory chemokines following treatment with TNF-&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] or exposure to heat-inactivated <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plant material and extraction procedures</title><p>Commercial mature <italic>Citrus bergamia </italic>fruits belonging to three different stocks from organic farming in Southern Italy were purchased and manually processed to completely remove the epicarp. The raw plant material obtained (150 g for each sample stock) were immediately suspended in 600 mL chloroform and processed for the extractions. The suspension was homogenized for 5 min and submitted to sonication in an ultrasound bath (Ultrasonik Mod. 104&#x000d7;, Ney Dental Inc., USA) in the dark at a constant temperature of 25&#x000b0;C. Subsequently, the samples were filtered and centrifuged for 20 min at 3000 <italic>rpm</italic>. The residue was re-extracted with 400 mL chloroform following the same procedure previously described. The collected chloroform extracts, named "extract 1", were partially reduced in volume with Rotavapor and then completely dried under nitrogen flow. The total extraction yield was 3.6 &#x000b1; 0.2%. Aliquots (5 g) of these sample extracts (extract 1) were subjected to fractional distillation at 350-400 Pa and 40&#x000b0;C, as described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], in order to completely remove volatile terpene compounds, and partly oxygenated chemicals. The sediment obtained at the end of distillation corresponded to the extract 2 samples with an extraction yield of 40.3 &#x000b1; 0.8%. One g of samples of extract 2 was then re-suspended in 20 mL diethyl ether, vigorously shaken for 30 min and centrifuged. The supernatant was removed and the residue, corresponding to extract 3 samples, was collected, dried under nitrogen flow and weighed (yield: 65.1 &#x000b1; 1.5%). For all laboratory processing care was taken to protect the operations from light and oxidizing conditions. All the solvents used were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Reagent European Pharmacopoeia purity. All the samples (extract 1, extract 2, extract 3) were stored in the dark in glass vials with Teflon-sealed caps at 2.0 &#x000b1; 0.5&#x000b0;C until analyses by GC-FID, GC-MS, and HPLC to identify and quantify putative bioactive compounds.</p></sec><sec><title>GC-FID and GC-MS analyses</title><p>The sample extracts were analyzed and the relative peak areas for volatile and oxygenated components weighted by GC-FID. The relative percentages were determined using GC TRACE Thermoquest, equipped with autosampler Triplus (Thermo Electron Corporation). The column was VF-5ms, 30 m &#x000d7; 0.25 mm. Flow rate was 1.0 mL/min He, and split 1:50. Injector temperature, 300&#x000b0;C; detector temperature, 350&#x000b0;C. Oven temperature was initially 55&#x000b0;C, raised to 100&#x000b0;C at a rate of 1&#x000b0;C/min, and then raised to 250&#x000b0;C at a rate of 5&#x000b0;C/min and finally held at that temperature for 15 min. One &#x003bc;l of each sample (15 mg/mL CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>) was injected. The percentage composition of volatile and oxygenated components was computed by the normalization method from the GC peak areas (data integration software: Jasco-Borwin version 1.5, JMBS Developments, Fontaine, France), without correction factors. Identification was performed by a Varian GC-3800 gas chromatograph equipped with a Varian MS-4000 mass spectrometer with electron impact and hooked to a NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) library. A Varian FactorFour VF-5ms poly-5% phenyl-95%-dimethyl-siloxane bonded phase column (i.d., 0.25 mm; length, 30 m; film thickness, 0.15 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>m) was used. Operating conditions were as follows: injector temperature 300&#x000b0;C; FID temperature 300&#x000b0;C, Carrier (Helium) flow rate 1.0 mL/min and split ratio 1:50. The MS (mass spectrometry) conditions were as follows: ionization voltage, 70 eV; emission current, 10 &#x003bc;Amp; scan rate, 1 scan/s; mass range, 29-400 Da; trap temperature, 150&#x000b0;C, transfer line temperature, 300&#x000b0;C. The main compounds were identified by comparing their relative retention time, KI (Kovats Index) and the MS fragmentation pattern with those of essential oils of known composition, with pure compounds and by matching the MS fragmentation patterns with the above mentioned mass spectra libraries and with those in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. To determine the Kovats index of the components, a commercial 24 aliphatic hydrocarbons mixture (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the sample extracts before injecting in the GC-MS equipment and analyzed under the same conditions as above.</p></sec><sec><title>HPLC analysis</title><p>HPLC analysis was performed to quantify the main constituents of the non-volatile fraction of bergamot essential oil. Therefore, pure commercial standards of bergaptol, bergamottin, bergapten, citropten and 5-geranyloxy-7-methoxycoumarin (Extrasynthese, France) were used as external standards to set up and calculate appropriate calibration curves. The experimental conditions were performed using a Jasco modular HPLC (Tokyo, Japan, Model PU 2089) coupled to a Diode Array apparatus (MD 2010 Plus) linked to an injection valve with a 20 &#x003bc;L sampler loop. The column used was a Tracer extrasil ODS2 25 &#x000d7; 0.46 cm, with a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The mobile phase employed consisted of the solvent solution B (methanol) and A (water/formic acid = 95/5). The gradient system adopted was characterized by 4 steps: 1. isocratic, with solvent solution B/A = 40/60 (%), for 2 min; 2. the solvent solution B raised progressively from 40 to 60% in 18 min (from min 2 to min 20) until reaching the ratio B/A = 60/40 (%); 3. the solvent solution B then raised 100% in 4 min (from min 20 to min 24); 4. the solvent solution ratio reached B/A = 40/60 in 4 min (from min 24 to min 28). Injection volume was 40.0 &#x003bc;l. Chromatograms were recorded and peaks from bergamot sample extracts were identified by comparing their spectra with spectra obtained with pure standards. Peak area was determined by integration using dedicated Borwin software (Borwin ver. 1.22, JMBS Developments, Grenoble, France). The qualitative and quantitative analyses of each extract were performed three times.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell cultures</title><p>IB3-1 cells and CuFi-1 cell lines were obtained from human bronchial epithelium derived from a CF patient with &#x00394;F508del/W1282X mutant genotype (IB3-1 cells) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and from a CF patient with a F508del/F508del mutant genotype (CuFi-1 cells) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. These cells were grown in LHC-8 basal medium (Biofluids), supplemented with 5% FBS in the absence of gentamycin. All culture flasks and plates were coated with a solution containing 35 mg/ml bovine collagen (Becton-Dickinson), 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and 1 mg/ml human fibronectin (Becton-Dickinson). Treatment with TNF-&#x003b1; (80 ng/ml) was performed on 70% confluent cells for 24 hours. Cell number/ml was determined after trypsin treatment by using a model ZBI Coulter Counter (Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL, USA).

Accordingly, there is a growing interest in developing therapies for CF in order to reduce the excessive inflammatory response in the airways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] of CF patients. In this respect, extracts from medicinal plants have been reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory activities in several reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>The major result of this article is the finding that extracts obtained from bergamot (<italic>Citrus bergamia </italic>Risso) epicarps, contain components displaying an inhibitory activity on IL-8 gene expression.

Further experiments are required to: (a) identify other biochemical targets of citropten and bergapten, as well as whether the inhibitory effects on IL-8 gene expression are reproducible in other cellular pathological systems in which this chemokine plays a role; (b) determine safety, potential toxicity, <italic>in vivo </italic>bioavailability, stability and whether suitable concentrations can be reached following in vivo administration and (c) <italic>in vivo </italic>anti-inflammatory effects. We would like to point out that our <italic>in vitro </italic>study does not guarantee for anti-inflammatory activity <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, published results support the concept that molecules affecting the expression of IL-8 <italic>in vitro </italic>on the IB3-1 system display also anti-inflammatory activity <italic>in vivo</italic>. For instance, Bergamini et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] found that exposure of IB3-1 cells to Azitromycin (AZT) significantly decreased gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) activity, restoring the levels to those observed in non-CF cells. Interestingly, in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of CF mice homozygous for the F508 del mutation, GST expression was undetectable, suggesting novel antioxidant properties for this drug. Another example are decoy oligonucleotides against NF-kB, which are potent inhibitors of IL-8 gene expression in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </italic>infected IB3-1 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. These decoys against NF-kB were found to reduce chronic inflammation in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>].</p><p>Moreover, it should be considered that coumarins compounds, as reported in literature, display anti-proteinase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. For example, serin proteinase is capable to degradate the matrix proteins and is involved in several inflammatory respiratory diseases as CF. It will be very interesting to investigate and correlate the anti-inflammatory effect of bergapten and citropten with their possible anti-proteinase activity. This double actions could be useful for the treatment of lung inflammation in CF patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>(CF): Cystic fibrosis; (NMR): nuclear magnetic resonance; (GC-FID): gas chromatography-flame ionization detector; (GC-MS): gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; (HPLC): high pressure liquid chromatography; (TNF): tumor necrosis factor; (CFTR): cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; (FBS): fetal bovine serum; (PCR): polymerase chain reaction; (IL): interleukin.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MB and IM carried out the real-time PCR and Bio-plex analyses; NB and IL performed cell culture and semi-quantitative PCR; AG and DR carried out extraction and chemical characterization of extracts; GS and RG supervised the experimental work and drafted the manuscript.
