Bile salts vary significantly in structure across vertebrate species, suggesting that receptors binding these molecules may show adaptive evolutionary changes in response. We have previously shown that FXRs from the sea lamprey (<italic>Petromyzon marinus</italic>) and zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) are activated by planar bile alcohols found in these two species. In this report, we characterize FXR, PXR, and VDR from the green-spotted pufferfish (<italic>Tetraodon nigriviridis</italic>), an actinopterygian fish that unlike the zebrafish has a bile salt profile similar to humans. We utilize homology modelling, docking, and pharmacophore studies to understand the structural features of the <italic>Tetraodon </italic>receptors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p><italic>Tetraodon </italic>FXR has a ligand selectivity profile very similar to human FXR, with strong activation by the synthetic ligand GW4064 and by the primary bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid. Homology modelling and docking studies suggest a ligand-binding pocket architecture more similar to human and rat FXRs than to lamprey or zebrafish FXRs. <italic>Tetraodon </italic>PXR was activated by a variety of bile acids and steroids, although not by the larger synthetic ligands that activate human PXR such as rifampicin. Homology modelling predicts a larger ligand-binding cavity than zebrafish PXR. We also demonstrate that VDRs from the pufferfish and Japanese medaka were activated by small secondary bile acids such as lithocholic acid, whereas the African clawed frog VDR was not.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our studies provide further evidence of the relationship between both FXR, PXR, and VDR ligand selectivity and cross-species variation in bile salt profiles. Zebrafish and green-spotted pufferfish provide a clear contrast in having markedly different primary bile salt profiles (planar bile alcohols for zebrafish and sterically bent bile acids for the pufferfish) and receptor selectivity that matches these differences in endogenous ligands. Our observations to date present an integrated picture of the co-evolution of bile salt structure and changes in the binding pockets of three nuclear hormone receptors across the species studied.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs) are transcription factors that work in concert with co-activators and co-repressors to regulate gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Most of the NHRs in vertebrates are ligand-activated, although some NHRs function in a ligand-independent manner. Examples of ligands for NHRs include a range of endogenous compounds such as bile acids, retinoids, steroid hormones, thyroid hormone, and vitamin D. A few NHRs, such as the pair of xenobiotic sensors, pregnane X receptor (PXR; NR1I2; also known as steroid and xenobiotic receptor or SXR) and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR; NR1I3), are activated by structurally diverse exogenous ligands. NHRs share a conserved domain structure, which includes, from N-terminus to C-terminus, a modulatory A/B domain, the DNA-binding domain (DBD; C domain), the 'hinge' D domain, the ligand-binding domain (LBD; E domain), and a variable C-terminal F domain that is absent in some NHRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>NHRs show varying degrees of sequence conservation across vertebrate species in the LBD that likely reflects, at least in part, cross-species variation in the physiologically important ligands. The xenobiotic sensors PXR and CAR show extensive cross-species amino acid sequence divergence across vertebrate species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] in addition to evidence of positive (Darwinian) selection in the LBD from phylogenetic analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Cross-species differences in xenobiotic ligands are a possible driving force for changes in the LBD sequence and structure. We and others have also provided data consistent with the hypothesis that the structure of the LBD of NHRs in the NR1 H and NR1I subfamilies may have co-evolved with the endogenous ligands in some species in evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Bile salts are one class of NHR ligands that show substantial cross-species differences in chemical structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Bile salts are amphipathic, water-soluble end-metabolites of cholesterol that facilitate intestinal absorption of lipids, enhance proteolytic cleavage of dietary proteins, and exert antimicrobial activity in the small intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Bile salts exhibit significant structural diversity across vertebrate species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and include <italic>bile alcohols </italic>(which have a hydroxyl group on the terminal carbon atom of the side-chain) and <italic>bile acids </italic>(which have a carboxylic acid group on the side-chain) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Primary bile salts are defined as those synthesized by the liver, which is accomplished by a complicated biosynthetic pathway that starts with cholesterol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Representative bile salts and their structures</bold>. All bile salts are derived from cholesterol (topmost structure), illustrated with the carbon atoms numbered and the steroid rings labelled A, B, C, and D. Jawless fish, lobe-finned fish, and a limited number of actinopterygian fish use 5&#x003b1; bile alcohols such as 5&#x003b1;-cyprinol-27-sulfate that have an overall planar and extended structure of the steroid rings (see representation of A, B, and C rings on the right side). Most actinopterygian fish (including medaka and <italic>Tetraodon nigrivirdis</italic>) use 5&#x003b2; bile acids that have an overall bent structure of the steroid rings. One of the two most common primary salts in mammals is chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), the stem C<sub>24 </sub>bile acid that has the basic 3&#x003b1;,7&#x003b1;-dihydroxylation pattern. Lithocholic acid is one of the smallest naturally occurring bile acids and results from bacterial enzyme-mediated deconjugation and dehydroxylation of primary bile acids. The sodium and calcium salts of lithocholic acid have very low solubility at body temperature. Additionally, lithocholic acid is toxic in humans and other mammals.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2091-12-5-1"/></fig><p>Secondary bile salts result from modification of primary bile salts by host bacteria in the intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Common alterations in bile acids catalyzed by enzymes from anaerobic bacteria in the intestinal tract include deconjugation and dehydroxylation, with one possible end result being unconjugated and poorly water-soluble bile acids such as lithocholic acid (3&#x003b1;-hydroxy-5&#x003b2;-cholan-24-oic acid; LCA), a compound known to be toxic to mammalian species including humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. There have been few studies of intestinal bile salts in animals that utilize bile alcohols, but one study of the Asiatic carp (<italic>Cyprinus carpio</italic>) showed that the bile alcohol sulfates synthesized in the liver of this species did not undergo hydrolysis in the intestinal tract and thus did not generate potentially toxic unconjugated secondary bile alcohols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Variation in the stereochemistry of the junction between rings A and B of the bile salt steroid nucleus determines whether bile salts have a flat (planar) or a 'bent' orientation. Based on surveys of the bile salt composition in 1153 vertebrate species, we have proposed that 5&#x003b1; (planar) bile alcohols are the likely ancestral ligands (the paleomorphic state) while 5&#x003b2; (bent) bile acids are the derived (apomorphic) phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Common 5&#x003b2;-bile acids include chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA; 3&#x003b1;,7&#x003b1;-dihydroxy-5&#x003b2;-cholan-24-oic acid) and cholic acid (CA; 3&#x003b1;,7&#x003b1;,12&#x003b1;-trihydroxy-5&#x003b2;-cholan-24-oic acid), the two dominant primary bile acids in humans and other mammals (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>PXRs are activated by a structurally diverse array of endogenous and exogenous molecules that includes bile salts, steroid hormones, prescription medications, herbal drugs, and endocrine disruptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. PXR regulates the transcription of enzymes and transporters involved in the metabolism and elimination of potentially harmful compounds, including sulfation of toxic bile acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Previous studies have shown substantial cross-species differences in PXR ligand specificity, including in the selectivity for bile salts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Mammalian PXRs are activated by a broad range of bile salt structures (both ancestral and evolutionarily derived), while chicken (<italic>Gallus gallus</italic>) and zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) PXRs are activated by a structurally narrow range of bile salts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. We and others have proposed that the evolution of PXRs has been driven by at least two factors: adaptation to evolutionary changes in bile salt (and perhaps other endogenous molecular) structure and function as a xenobiotic sensor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Compared with published X-ray crystallographic structures of human PXR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], a homology model of the zebrafish PXR is predicted to have a smaller ligand-binding pocket (LBP) than human PXR, with a flat ligand-binding surface well-suited to binding the planar 5&#x003b1;-bile alcohols that are the primary bile salts of zebrafish and other cypriniform fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>FXR serves as the major transcriptional regulator of bile salt synthesis, in part by controlling the expression of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 7A1, the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthetic pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Mammalian FXRs are activated best by primary bile acids CDCA and CA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. FXR is typically expressed at high levels in the liver, intestine, kidney, and adrenal glands. A second FXR, termed FXR&#x003b2; (NR1H5), is found in some animal species (although it is a pseudogene in the genome of some mammals such as humans and other primates) but does not appear to be involved with bile salt binding or regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Throughout this manuscript, FXR refers to NR1H4, or what might be termed FXR&#x003b1; in species possessing two FXRs.</p><p>The African clawed frog (<italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>) expresses an unusual FXR (also termed FOR, FXR-like orphan receptor) that has a 33 amino acid insert, not found in mammalian FXRs, in helix 7 of the ligand-binding domain (LBD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. We have previously demonstrated that sea lamprey (<italic>Petromyzon marinus</italic>), zebrafish, and African clawed frog FXRs are activated by bile alcohols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Sea lamprey and zebrafish FXRs are selective for planar 5&#x003b1; bile alcohols. The <italic>Xenopus </italic>FXR isoform 1 was activated by 5&#x003b1;- and 5&#x003b2;-bile alcohols (paralleling the complex bile salt profile of this amphibian [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]) but was poorly activated by bile acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p><p>The vitamin D receptor (VDR; NR1I1) is known to mediate the action of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol), a hormone whose 'classic' function is to regulate calcium and phosphorus homeostasis. However, VDRs are now known to be involved in a wide range of physiological processes including immune system modulation, skin development, and regulation of the metabolism of toxic compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Two VDR genes have been found in the genome of many actinopterygian fish (a likely by-product of whole genome duplication prior to actinopterygian fish radiation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], with VDR&#x003b1; and VDR&#x003b2; both shown to be functional in the Japanese medaka (<italic>Oryzias latipes</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Mammalian VDRs are activated at low affinity by a narrow range of 5&#x003b2;-bile acids, particularly the toxic secondary bile acid LCA and its derivatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. VDR activation in the intestine has been shown to upregulate the expression of enzymes (e.g., CYP3A) that can metabolize and reduce the toxicity of LCA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. We previously determined that the VDR from the sea lamprey (<italic>Petromyzon marinus</italic>) was insensitive to activation by a wide array of bile salts, including bile acids and bile alcohols with a range of substituents. We proposed the hypothesis that activation of VDRs by bile acids is a 'derived' trait, possibly as an adaptation to evolutionary changes in bile salt pathways and vertebrate physiology that allow for generation of toxic secondary bile acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>In this report, we characterize the ligand selectivity of FXR, VDR, and PXR from the green-spotted pufferfish (<italic>Tetraodon nigriviridis</italic>), an actinopterygian fish that synthesizes mainly the 5&#x003b2;-bile acids CA and CDCA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], thereby having a bile salt profile similar to most mammals. We also cloned and characterized VDRs from three additional non-mammalian species: medaka, African clawed frog, and chicken (<italic>Gallus gallus</italic>). In terms of primary bile salts, the medaka synthesizes a mixture of 5&#x003b2; C<sub>24 </sub>and C<sub>27 </sub>bile acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>].

The chicken synthesizes mainly CA and CDCA as primary bile salts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>We generated homology models of <italic>Tetraodon </italic>FXR (tnFXR) and PXR (tnPXR) using rat FXR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>] and human PXR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] crystallographic structures, respectively, as templates. We then performed computational ligand docking experiments to these receptors. This allowed for comparison to the structures of the corresponding mammalian receptors, helping to formulate hypotheses to rationalize the structural changes that have occurred during receptor evolution. Additionally, we build on our previous docking studies with bile acids and human VDR (hVDR) and expand structure-activity series of bile acids at this receptor. Combining information from docking experiments and cross-species sequence comparisons, we generated site-directed mutations and chimeras to better understand the molecular determinants of bile salt activation of VDRs.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Bile salt profile of <italic>Tetraodon nigriviridis</italic></title><p>We previously reported a survey of the biliary bile salts of 213 fish species from 38 different orders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].

These mutations were performed in mVDR, which generally has higher maximal activation by bile acids but shows a similar selectivity for bile acids to hVDR. Three residues, previously identified by the hVDR docking model as key to bile acid activation - Arg-269 (R269; charge clamp to carboxylic acid group on bile acid side-chain), His-392 (H392; hydrogen bond to 3&#x003b1;-hydroxy group of LCA), Phe-417 (F417; stabilization of helix 12) - were mutated individually to two other amino acid resides.

Thus, we generated hVDR that lacked amino acid residues 165-218 (hVDR/&#x00394;ins) and an hVDR construct where the insert domain was replaced with the insertion domain from the bile acid-insensitive xlVDR (hVDR/xlVDRins).

However, the skate FXR showed significant differences in sequence from other vertebrate FXRs, including novel insertions, and there is the possibility that this receptor is actually orthologous to mammalian FXR&#x003b2; (NR1H5), which are activated not by bile salts but instead by other steroidal compounds such as lanosterol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>Homology modelling of tnPXR predicts a receptor with an LBP with a volume (1,230 &#x000c5;<sup>3</sup>) significantly larger than the estimated volumes of the LBPs of zebrafish PXR (~1,000 &#x000c5;<sup>3</sup>) and <italic>Xenopus laevis </italic>PXR&#x003b1; (~860 &#x000c5;<sup>3</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>] but smaller than the LBP of hPXR in crystallographic structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The homology model and docking studies of tnPXR are consistent with our studies of recombinant tnPXR in luciferase reporter assays that show activation by a wider range of ligands than can activate either zebrafish or <italic>Xenopus </italic>PXRs. For example, tnPXR is activated by a broad range of 5&#x003b2;- and 5&#x003b1;-bile salts and steroids similar to hPXR. In contrast, studies of recombinant zebrafish PXR show activation by a narrow range of planar 5&#x003b1;-bile alcohols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The pharmacophore model for tnPXR is similar to models of hPXR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>] which have four hydrophobic features along with a hydrogen bond acceptor, although the tnPXR pharmacophore had three hydrophobic features and a hydrogen bond donor, consistent with a somewhat more restricted LBP limited to smaller ligands than hPXR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. Like hPXR, tnPXR has a pharmacophore model markedly different from that of chicken and zebrafish PXRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>Overall, the ligand selectivity of tnFXR and tnPXR contrasts with that of sea lamprey FXR, zebrafish FXR, and zebrafish PXR, which are activated better by 5&#x003b1; bile alcohols, which are the main bile salts of jawless fish (Agnatha, which includes extant lampreys and hagfish) and Cypriniformes (which includes zebrafish) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Unlike lampreys and zebrafish, <italic>Tetraodon nigriviridis </italic>has a bile salt profile of mainly bent 5&#x003b2;-bile acids such as CDCA, and would thus be predicted to have bile-salt-regulating NHRs that can recognize <italic>Tetraodon </italic>endogenous bile acids and not the 'ancestral' bile alcohols that comprise only a trace fraction of the <italic>Tetraodon </italic>bile salt pool. These results lend further significant support to the hypothesis that structural changes to the LBD of FXR and PXR throughout evolution have paralleled cross-species changes in bile salt profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. In Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref> bile salt variation and NHR bile salt sensitivity are overlaid on a fish phylogeny. So far, only a limited number of fish species have been characterized with respect to their FXRs, VDRs, and/or PXRs. As discussed in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref> a number of fish groups would be of particular interest for future studies of NHRs, including the Elasmobranchii (sharks, skates, rays), Chimaeriformes (chimaerae), Myxiniformes (hagfish), and lobe-finned fish (lungfish and coelacanths).</p><p>Our present and previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] with VDRs from various non-mammalian species have revealed some VDRs that are insensitive to bile acids (sea lamprey, African clawed frog) and others that are activated by secondary bile acids such as LCA (human, mouse, chicken, medaka, <italic>Tetraodon</italic>). In humans and some other mammals, enzymes from anaerobic bacteria in the caecum deconjugate and dehydroxylate primary bile acids such as CDCA, leading to secondary bile acids such as LCA that can produce toxicity to the intestinal and hepatobiliary tracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. We and others have speculated that the ability of VDRs to bind secondary bile acids was acquired during vertebrate evolution as a protective mechanism against the potential toxicity of poorly water-soluble secondary bile acids such as LCA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. One challenge to this hypothesis is that there has been little study to date of the secondary bile salts (and the anaerobic bacterial intestinal flora that could generate such bile salts) of non-mammalian species. For example, it is not known whether <italic>Tetraodon </italic>or other actinopterygian fish species have physiologically important amounts of secondary bile acids in the intestinal tract. With these caveats in mind, we summarize our studies of VDRs across different species.</p><p>The structure-activity and molecular modelling data are both consistent with a tight, hydrophobic binding pocket for bile acids in the human VDR LBP that can bind bile acids with an oxo or single hydroxyl group at the C-3 position but not bile acids with substituents at the C-7 or C-12 positions (including unnatural bile acids with a single hydroxyl group on C-7 or C-12 and no substituent on C-3). Molecular modeling predicts an hVDR bile acid binding pocket that is predominantly hydrophobic but with polar features that permit hydrogen bond interaction with the 3&#x003b1;-hydroxy or 3-oxo group on the A ring of the bile acid and electrostatic interactions with the bile acid side-chain as described above. Bile acids that have hydroxyl groups on steroid rings B and/or C (CDCA, DCA, CA, 7&#x003b1;-hydroxy-5&#x003b2;-cholanic acid, 7&#x003b2;-hydroxy-5&#x003b2;-cholanic acid, and 12&#x003b1;-hydroxy-5&#x003b2;-cholanic acid) do not interact favourably with the more hydrophobic and sterically constrained portion of the hVDR bile acid binding pocket, consistent with the lack of activity of these bile acids in transactivation assays. On the contrary, the unsubstituted and hydrophobic B, C, and D rings of LCA complement well the lipophilic portion of hVDR pocket and can form numerous van der Waals interactions. We suggested that the unique physicochemical arrangement of the hVDR ligand binding cavity provides the structural basis for selective activation by LCA and its derivatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>It is less clear, even with our mutagenesis studies, exactly what changes mediate the cross-species differences in VDR pharmacology. Our studies rule out the helix 1 - helix 3 'insertion' domain as playing a role in the cross-species differences in activation by secondary bile acids. This insert is disordered in human and mouse VDRs and shows highly variable sequences and lengths across species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>]. Our site-directed mutagenesis experiments do confirm the previous prediction that Arg-274 and His-397 play a key role in interacting with bile acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Interestingly, Arg-274 and His-397 are conserved in the bile salt-insensitive xlVDR, indicating that other determinants underlie the differences in bile salt pharmacology between xlVDR and bile-salt responsive VDRs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our studies provide further important evidence of the relationship between FXR, PXR, and VDR ligand selectivity and cross-species variation in bile salt profiles. Zebrafish and the green-spotted pufferfish <italic>Tetraodon nigriviridis </italic>provide a clear contrast in having markedly different primary bile salt profiles (planar bile alcohols for zebrafish and sterically bent bile acids for the pufferfish) and correspondingly contrasting receptor selectivity that matches the differences in endogenous ligands.

Full-length transcripts were subsequently determined by identifying transcriptional start and stop codons for each gene. cDNAs containing a complete open reading frame for each gene were produced by PCR using primer sets that spanned the entire nucleic acid sequence for each gene including start and stop codons. cDNAs were produced from extracts of fish liver total RNA. Livers were homogenized with 1 mL RNA Bee (Tel-Test, Inc. Friendswood, TX, USA) using a stainless steel Polytron homogenizer (Kinematica, Lucerne, Switzerland) followed by cleanup and on- column DNase treatment using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA).</p><p>RNA was eluted with 30 &#x003bc;l RNase-free water.

First strand cDNA was made from total RNA (1-3 &#x003bc;g) and diluted with RNase-free water to a final volume of 10 &#x003bc;l, and 1 &#x003bc;l oligo(dT)<sub>15 </sub>(500 &#x003bc;g/ml; Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and 1 &#x003bc;l 10 mM dNTPs were mixed with diluted RNA to yield a final volume of 20 &#x003bc;l.

Following a 2 min incubation, 1 &#x003bc;l Superscript Reverse Transcriptase (200 U/&#x003bc;l; Invitrogen) was added to each reaction and mRNA reverse transcribed at 37&#x000b0;C for 1 h. All reverse transcription (RT) reactions were then inactivated by incubating at 70&#x000b0;C for 15 min. cDNAs were stored at -20&#x000b0;C until PCR. PCR primers for teleost VDR&#x003b1; were designed using PrimerQuest (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA, USA). PCR primers were flanked by restriction sites for incorporation and transfer between appropriate cloning and expression vectors. For each 25-&#x003bc;l PCR reaction, first-strand cDNAs were amplified using 2 &#x003bc;l (100-300 ng) first-strand cDNA, 9 &#x003bc;l RNase-free water, 0.75 &#x003bc;l 10 &#x003bc;M forward primer (0.3 &#x003bc;M), 0.75 &#x003bc;l 10 &#x003bc;M reverse primer (0.3 &#x003bc;M), and 12.5 &#x003bc;l 2X Advantage Taq PCR Master Mix (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA).

To permit comparison between species and to avoid mismatching of non-mammalian receptors with mammalian retinoid X receptor, co-factors, and chromatin remodeling factors, all receptors were studied as LBD/GAL4 chimeras. For the GAL4/LBD expression constructs, the reporter plasmid is tk-UAS-Luc, which contains GAL4 DNA binding elements driving luciferase expression.

Thus, we generated hVDR/&#x00394;ins that lacked amino acid residues 165-218 (hVDR/&#x00394;ins) and a hVDR construct where the insert domain was replaced with the insertion domain from bile acid-insensitive xlVDR (hVDR/xlVDRins; hVDR residues 158-223 replaced by xlVDR residues 160-218).
