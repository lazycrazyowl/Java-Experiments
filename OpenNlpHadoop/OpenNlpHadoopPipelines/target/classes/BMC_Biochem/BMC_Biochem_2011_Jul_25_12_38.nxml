Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are considered to play a central role in the remodeling of basement membranes and ECM. However, MMPs contribute to vascular remodeling not only by degrading ECM components. Specific MMPs enhance angiogenesis via several ways; they help pericytes to detach from vessels undergoing angiogenesis, release ECM-bound angiogenic growth factors, expose cryptic pro-angiogenic integrin binding sites in the ECM, generate promigratory ECM component fragments, and cleave endothelial cell-cell adhesions. MMPs can also negatively influence the angiogenic process through generating endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors by proteolytic cleavage. Angiostatin, a proteolytic fragment of plasminogen, is one of the most potent antagonists of angiogenesis that inhibits migration and proliferation of endothelial cells. Reports have shown that metalloelastase, pancreas elastase, plasmin reductase, and plasmin convert plasminogen to angiostatin.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We report here that MMP-19 processes human plasminogen in a characteristic cleavage pattern to generate three angiostatin-like fragments with a molecular weight of 35, 38, and 42 kDa. These fragments released by MMP-19 significantly inhibited the proliferation of HMEC cells by 27% (p = 0.01) and reduced formation of capillary-like structures by 45% (p = 0.05) compared with control cells. As it is known that angiostatin blocks hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-induced pro-angiogenic signaling in endothelial cells due to structural similarities to HGF, we have analyzed if the plasminogen fragments generated by MMP-19 interfere with this pathway. As it involves the activation of c-met, the receptor of HGF, we could show that MMP-19-dependent processing of plasminogen decreases the phosphorylation of c-met.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Altogether, MMP-19 exhibits an anti-angiogenic effect on endothelial cells via generation of angiostatin-like fragments.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Angiogenesis is the process of formation of capillaries that sprout from existing blood vessels.

Human and murine orthologues of MMP-19 (human: U37791, murine: AF153199) retain the common domain organization of soluble members of the MMP family, however, they also contain several distinctive features including a unique cysteine in the catalytic domain, an altered latency motif, a unique oligoglutamate insertion in the hinge region, and a C-terminal tail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].

Vascular smooth muscle cells, myoepithelial cells, and basal keratinocytes express MMP-19 constitutively whereas endothelial cells, epithelial cells of the mammary glands as well as monocytes and macrophages show differential regulation of this enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>MMP-19 was reported to degrade several basement membrane proteins such as type IV collagen, laminin 5 &#x003b3;2 chain, tenascin C, and nidogen-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].

Whereas the Glu-variant is the native form of the protein, the Lys-variant is generated by cleavage of the peptide bond between Lys77 and Lys78 by plasmin. In contrast to the Glu-type plasminogen, we observed self-degradation of the Lys-type form, even in the presence of the serine protease inhibitor aprotinin. Thus, we decided to continue the experiments with the Glu-type variant, which does not have any plasmin activity and nearly no self-degradation. As controls, we used samples with MMP inhibitor (MMP-9/MMP-13 inhibitor II) or the inactive MMP-19 mutant (E213A) instead of the wild-type fusion protein. The MMP-19 fusion protein was generated and purified as described in "Methods". The expected size of the purified fusion protein was 85 kDa as detected by Coomassie staining and immunoblotting using anti-MMP-19 antibody (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, arrowhead). The strong protein band of approximately 40 kDa appearing in the Coomassie stained SDS-PAGE is a peptide composed of the N-terminal GST-tag and the propeptide domain of MMP-19, which is generated during purification due to autocatalytic activity of MMP-19.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Purification and detection of recombinant GST-MMP-19 proteins</bold>.

The protein band about 92 kDa represents the full-length Glu-type plasminogen. As the angiostatin-like fragments consist of the N-terminal part of plasminogen the bands below 66 kDa are the corresponding C-terminal parts of the cleaved protein. Comparing the time course of this reaction, an increase of the putative angiostatin-like fragments over time was obvious (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).

Under certain conditions, plasminogen undergoes proteolysis to form kringle-containing A-chain fragments, collectively called angiostatins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], which are novel and potent inhibitors of endothelial cell proliferation and tumor angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Typically, angiostatin consists of the first four kringle domains (K1-4). Plasminogen is cleaved by several proteases, among them members of matrix metalloproteinase family, that are derived from tumor cells or infiltrating macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. These kringle domains and their relatives inhibit the proliferation of vascular endothelial cells, a fundamental process in angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>As MMP-19 was reported to be expressed by endothelial cells as well as cells that surround endothelium and capillaries, it could be expected that its activity likely impacts vascular processes including angiogenesis. Our experiments show that MMP-19 has angiostatin-converting enzyme activity and generates angiostatin-like fragments similar to MMP-3, -7, -9, and -12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The cleavage site is located between kringle 5 and the protease domain to generate angiostatin molecules consisting of all five kringle domains of plasminogen. As all reported angiostatin species exhibit the biological activities of angiostatin isolated from plasma (e.g. inhibition of endothelial proliferation, angiogenesis, and tumor growth and metastasis), the angiostatin-like fragments generated by MMP-19 should also have such biological activities.</p><p>Angiogenic growth factors and inflammatory cytokines can induce a number of pericellular acting proteases, including MT1-MMP, MMP-2, MMP-9, and u-PA. This is generally seen as a part of the repertoire of cellular activities that are switched on when the pro-angiogenic growth factors overrule the angiogenesis-inhibiting factors. However, this unidirectional view on the relation between angiogenic growth factors and proteases has evolved into the insight that proteases themselves also contribute to fine-tuning of the activities of various growth factors that control the onset and progression of angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Different members of the MMP family may generate angiostatin-like fragments with different efficiency and with different composition. The contribution of MMP-19 and other MMPs to angiostatin generation <italic>in vivo </italic>will depend on their expression pattern, the rate of their activity, and also inactivation by endogenous inhibitors. This mechanism may be further complicated by interactions between different MMPs as well as by multiple proteolytic activities towards extracellular matrix proteins in basement membrane or vascular bed. Thus, MMP-19 could further increase its anti-angiogenic effect by damage of basement membrane scaffold that supports differentiation processes of endothelial cells. MMP-19 could achieve this by cleavage of at least three important basement membrane components: tenascin C, &#x003b3;2chain of laminin5, and nidogen-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In our previous study we could show that high concentrations of MMP-19 might have negative influence on endothelial cell growth as MMP-19-dependent processing of nidogen-1 led to inhibition of tube-like formation <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. As higher concentrations of MMP-19 could influence or interfere with effects of processed plasminogen we tested the remaining MMP-19 fusion proteins in the processed plasminogen mixture on endothelial cells as well. However, MMP-19 under these experimental conditions did not exhibit any effect on the cells.</p><p>Moreover, current data show that MMP-19 exhibit also critical antitumor activity as secreted active MMP-19, but not the inactive mutant, induces reduction of tube-forming ability in endothelial cells with decreased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Thus, MMP-19 seems to be responsible, at least partly, for bioavailability of MMP-2 and VEGF that promote angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In contrast, the MMP-19-deficient mice showed decreased tumor angiogenesis and invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] pointing, thus, to a potential dual role of MMP-19. The pro-angiogenic role of MMP-19 could be associated with its expression in microvascular endothelial cells or smooth muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and in the controlled release of pro-angiogenic factors such as VEGF and MMP-2; the anti-angiogenic effect of MMP-19 might originate from uncontrolled overproduction of this MMP from various surrounding cellular sources, which can disrupt the necessary ECM scaffold or, as here reported, produce angiostatin-like fragments.</p><p>As MMP-19 generates angiostatin-like fragments that subsequently inhibit endothelial cell proliferation and tube-like formation, we asked, which pathways are involved in this inhibition. c-Met is the HGF receptor that controls cellular mobility due to tyrosine-kinase activity. HGF binding to its receptor induces the tyrosine autophosphorylation of the receptor catalytic domain that initiates the intracellular signaling. Angiostatin has structural similarities to HGF that promotes angiogenesis, induces proliferation, migration, and also influences cell survival via its cell surface receptor, c-Met. Upon HGF stimulation, c-Met induces several biological responses that collectively give rise to a program known as invasive growth. It is thought that angiostatin inhibits HGF-induced phosphorylation of c-Met, Akt, and ERK1/2 via binding to soluble c-Met. Angiostatin and c-Met form a stable complex and affect signaling events induced by HGF but not by VEGF or bFGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>The inhibition of Akt phosphorylation by angiostatin is not solely a marker for the inhibition of HGF binding to c-met; instead, a reduction in phospho-Akt could directly contribute to the disruption of angiogenesis. Akt is a serine/threonine kinase that is rapidly activated as a downstream effector of phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI3) kinase in response to a variety of cytokines and growth factors, including HGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. In this work we could show that MMP-19-processed plasminogen inhibits the HGF-induced phosphorylation of c-Met and Akt/PKB and that plasminogen fragments generated by MMP-19 impact proliferation and tube-like formation of endothelial cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We report here that MMP-19 processes human plasminogen and generates angiostatin-like fragments that inhibit proliferation microvascular endothelial cells, decreases the phosphorylation of c-met, and reduce formation of capillary-like structures.

The fractions were pooled and dialysed over night at 4&#x000b0;C against 2 l TNC buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.4) using a Slide-a-lyser cassette (PIERCE, Ulm, Germany) to get rid of the reduced glutathione. The concentration was determined using BCA kit (PIERCE, Ulm, Germany).</p><p>Immunoblotting for MMP-19 was performed using a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Dianova, dilution 1:3000) against the hinge region of MMP-19. This antibody detected the zymogen, the active protein as well as wild-type (WT) and inactive mutant (EA).</p><p>The murine proMMP-9 protein as a control was expressed in Cos7 cells. The protein was purified by affinity chromatography binding to a gelatine sepharose column (GE Healthcare, Freiburg, Germany). Before using recombinant MMP-9 in the cleavage assay it has to be activated with trypsin (10 &#x003bc;g/ml) at 37&#x000b0;C for 20 min. The reaction was stopped by adding trypsin inhibitor (1 mg/ml).</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of proteolytic fragments of plasminogen and analysis</title><p>The processing of 10 &#x003bc;g plasminogen (human Glu-type plasminogen, Calbiochem or Lys-type plasminogen, Chromogenix) was done in TNC buffer + 10 &#x003bc;M ZnCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.4 with 50 &#x003bc;l GST-MMP-19 (8 &#x003bc;g) at 37&#x000b0;C for 96 h; samples were taken every 24 h. To determine the specificity we used the following controls: One control was without any enzyme to observe the self-processing. Second control was the use of GST-MMP-19 inactive mutant (E213A) instead of active protein. Third control contained an MMP-19 inhibitor (10 nM; MMP-9/MMP-13 inhibitor II, Calbiochem), which was chosen because of the strong inhibition of recombinant human MMP-19 (data not shown). To avoid the activation and the autocatalytic activity of the zymogene plasminogen to its active form plasmin (a serine protease), we used serine protease inhibitor Aprotinin (1 &#x003bc;g/ml; Sigma, Germany). Also a control without Aprotinin was analyzed. To compare the efficiency of the cleavage to other MMPs 10 &#x003bc;g plasminogen (human Glu-type plasminogen, Calbiochem) was incubated with 5 &#x003bc;g recombinant MMP-9 using the same experimental conditions. proMMP-9 was activated prior to trypsin treatment at 37&#x000b0;C for 20 min. The mixture of digested plasminogen fragments was used without further purification in the tube-like formation assay.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>Human microvascular endothelial cells (HMECs), kindly provided by Prof. Marm&#x000e9; (Freiburg, Germany), were cultured in Endothelial Cell Growth Medium MV with Supplement Mix (EGM-MV) (Promocell, Heidelberg, Germany) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>at 37&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec><title>Endothelial cell proliferation assay</title><p>A 96-well flat bottom plate was coated with GST-MMP-19 processed plasminogen or the following controls: unprocessed plasminogen (2.5 &#x003bc;g/well), GST-MMP-19 WT or EA (2.0 &#x003bc;g/well), GST-MMP-19 with inhibitor, aprotinin, or TNC buffer. An uncoated plate served as additional control. HMECs were then added (2500 cells/well) and the plate incubated at 37&#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. To evaluate the effect of the processed Glu-type plasminogen on cell proliferation, we used the Alamar Blue colorimetric assay (Biosource, Solingen, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoblotting</title><p>HMEC-1 cells, were grown for 40 h in EGM-MV (Promocell) supplemented with reaction buffer (sodium phosphate) alone, with aprotinin (1 &#x003bc;g/ml), with MMP-19 (2 &#x003bc;g/well), or with processed and unprocessed plasminogen as described above. Cell lysates were prepared as described previously and 40 &#x003bc;g protein per sample was applied to SDS-PAGE; anti-phosphorylated c-Met (Biosource, dilution 1:500 in TBS + 1% BSA) or anti-phosphorylated Akt/PKB (Biosource, dilution 1:500 in TBS + 1% BSA) were used for detection. Bound antibody was detected using peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (PIERCE, USA) and the ECL plus Western Blotting Detection System (GE Healthcare, UK). Signals were recorded with a Luminescent Image Analyzer (LAS-3000, Fujifilm Life Science, USA) and analyzed with AIDA image analysis software (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany). Densitometric scans of the signal intensity of phospho-c-Met and phosphor-Akt/PKB bands are normalized for the corresponding signal intensity of &#x003b2;-actin bands; the buffer control was set as 100%.</p></sec><sec><title>Tube-like formation assay <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>To evaluate the angiogenic effects of the plasminogen fragments <italic>in vitro</italic>, a tube-like formation assay was adapted from <italic>Kubota et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and <italic>Donovan et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Shortly, Matrigel (BD Bioscience, Heidelberg, Germany) was coated according to the manufacturer's protocol. The inner well of angiogenesis plates (&#x003bc;-Slide Angiogenesis, ibidi, Martinsried, Germany), were filled with 10 &#x003bc;l Matrigel. The plate was incubated for 37&#x000b0;C to allow the Matrigel to gel and 5000 HMEC-1 cells per well were seeded onto the matrix. Images were captured using a digital camera and Olympus IX 51 microscope. Capillary-like formation, i.e. tubuli length, was evaluated after 24 h of incubation at 37&#x000b0;C. Two independent experiments were conducted and at least 3 wells evaluated per experiment. The total length of tubuli was measured in pixels using the image analysis software imageJ (NIH, US). The tubuli length is given as mean percentage of the control (&#x000b1; SD). To study the effect of the processed plasminogen the fragments were added to HMEC-1 cells. The same amount of non-processed plasminogen (1.25 &#x003bc;g/well) and recombinant MMP-19 (1 &#x003bc;g/well) was used as controls.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>MMP: matrix metalloproteinase; GST: glutathione-S-transferase; HMECs: human microvascular endothelial cells; HGF: hepatocyte growth factor; IPTG: isopropyl-1-thio-&#x003b2;-D-galactopyranoside; VEGF: vascular endothelial growth factor; bFGF: basic fibroblast growth factor.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>RB carried out most of the experimental work and helped to draft the manuscript.
