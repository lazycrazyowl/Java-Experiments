Both protein families possess a conserved ATP-binding domain called P-loop (formerly Walker motif A: GXXG(X)XGKT(X); [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. However, ATP-binding which is not based on a specific ATP-binding domain, is described for many other proteins like lactoferrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], bovine serum albumin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] or gelsolin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Recently, the interaction of ATP with growth factors was discovered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The physiological role of this ATP-binding to growth factors remained unclear. However, binding of ATP to NGF and FGF2 seems to be essential for their neuroprotectivity as demonstrated with hippocampal neuronal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The heparin binding domain (HBD) of both growth factors is important for ATP-binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] although crystallographic data of the growth factor/ATP-complexes are not yet available.</p><p>Complex formation of ATP with NGF and FGF2 is probably based on ionic interaction of the negatively charged phosphate residues of ATP with positively charged arginine and lysine residues located in the HBD of NGF and FGF2, respectively. This is similar to the interaction of sulphate residues of heparin or heparan sulphate-proteoglycans (HSPGs) with heparin-binding growth factors like fibroblast growth factors, VEGF, NGF or PDGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Additionally, binding of ATP to FGF2 stabilizes the growth factor and protects it from thermal degradation and proteolytic cleavage with trypsin, neutrophil elastase (NE) or plasmin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>In this paper we determined the dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of ATP-binding to FGF2 and analyzed the impact on the conformation of the protein. Furthermore, we investigated the consequence of this nucleotide binding on FGF2 stability in aqueous solution to get a more detailed insight into this probably important protein-ligand interaction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Equilibrium-microdialysis</title><p>Rapid equilibrium dialysis inserts (RED device inserts, Pierce, IL, USA) were used along with Teflon Base Plate (Pierce, Il, USA) for equilibrium dialysis experiments.

One chamber was filled with FGF2 (10 &#x003bc;M) in 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (550 &#x003bc;L), and the other with various concentrations of ATP in 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The dialysis inserts were rotated at room temperature with a speed of 250 rpm and equilibrium was reached within 4 h as monitored by counting an aliquot from both sides of the membrane at different time points during dialysis. After 4 h, 50 &#x003bc;L aliquots of the dialysis chambers were removed and kept on ice. ATP was determined immediately.

To characterize this binding of ATP to FGF2 in more detail, we used equilibrium microdialysis to directly examine the ATP-binding properties of the growth factor. Equilibrium microdialysis was performed with 10 &#x003bc;M FGF2 in the reaction chamber. As ATP concentrations increased from 1 to 80 &#x003bc;M, the amount of ATP bound to FGF2 increased as well reaching a maximum level and indicating a saturation binding behavior (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Consistent with the radiolabeling experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and MALDI-TOF data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], FGF2 (10 &#x003bc;M) clearly bound ATP at concentrations between 1 and 80 &#x003bc;M. ATP binding data were replotted in a Scatchard plot and the binding constant was calculated. The linear Scatchard plot gave a value of 1.2 for the number of independent binding sites, indicating that one molecule ATP binds to one molecule FGF2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). The calculated dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) is 59.8 &#x003bc;M.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Binding of ATP to FGF2 and nucleotide-induced conformational change</bold>.

The CD-spectrum of FGF2 (concentration: 25 &#x003bc;M) showed a curve progression characteristic for a protein rich in &#x003b2;-structure (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). The signal decreased from 230 nm onward reaching a broad minimum around 205 nm to increase again to the base level, as it has been reported previously for NGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In contrast to untreated FGF2, FGF2 incubated with ATP (100 &#x003bc;M) showed a clear decrease of the amplitude of the broad minimum (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>) and no increase afterwards to the base level at 195 nm. This indicates a decrease of percentage of &#x003b2;-structure and finally a conformational change of FGF2 after interaction with this nucleotide. In contrast, the CD-spectrum of FGF2 did not significantly change after addition of AMP (100 &#x003bc;M). After addition of ADP (100 &#x003bc;M) the CD-spectrum changed only moderately compared to untreated FGF2.</p></sec><sec><title>Influence of ATP on dimerization behaviour of FGF2</title><p>Previous studies reported dimerization of FGF2 and additional receptor binding induced by heparin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].

Addition of 1 mM ATP and BS<sup>3 </sup>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, lane 5) did not induce dimerization whereas addition of heparin and BS<sup>3 </sup>did (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, lane 3). However, co-incubation of FGF2 with heparin (10 &#x003bc;g/mL), ATP (1 mM) and BS<sup>3 </sup>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, lane 6) did promote formation of dimers with a similar dimer/monomer ratio as observed for incubation with heparin and subsequently BS<sup>3</sup>-crosslinking only (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, lane 3).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>FGF2 monomers and dimers after cross-linking and variant forms of FGF2 after proteolytic degradation</bold>.

Here, we investigated the stability of mutant FGF2(K134A) against degradation by neutrophil elastase (NE). The K134A variant showed a partial stability against degradation by NE independent of this protein being preincubated with ATP or not (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Addition of ATP did not additionally protect FGF2(K134A) from protease digestion as revealed by silver staining.

Therefore, we performed stability experiments of FGF2 in Tris-buffered aqueous solution at 37&#x000b0;C and subsequently determined FGF2-concentration by ELISA. We incubated untreated FGF2, preincubated with ATP (200 &#x003bc;M) or preincubated with heparin (10 &#x003bc;g/mL) at 37&#x000b0;C for 2 h.

It was generally observed that with an increasing number of phosphate residues the protective effect on FGF2 against tryptic degradation increased respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Inositol hexaphosphate (6 phosphate residues) revealed a strong protection of the growth factor from tryptic digestion, whereas ATP and tripolyphosphate (3 phosphate residues) showed a slightly decreased protective effect.

Growth factors have been identified as ATP-binding proteins only recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived growth factor (BDNF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; personal communication R. Gast) and FGF2 are associated with ATP which is very likely to be important for their biological activity.</p><p>In this work, the binding affinity of ATP to FGF2 was determined by equilibrium microdialysis. The K<sub>D </sub>value of 59.8 &#x003bc;M showed only moderate binding of ATP to FGF2 which is contradictory to the binding affinities described for most kinases/ATP- and ATPases/ATP-complexes. This moderate binding constant is well observed to be not consistent with the ATP-concentration in the low nmolar range necessary for neuroprotective activity of FGF2 in cell culture experiments demonstrated recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Based on the experiments described in this paper, a high affine binding domain of ATP besides the 59.8 &#x003bc;molar binding domain is very likely to be present. However, the K<sub>D </sub>values of other ATP-binding proteins, e.g. gelsolin (K<sub>D </sub>32 &#x003bc;M, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]), p-glycoprotein (K<sub>D </sub>200 &#x003bc;M; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]) and metallothionein (K<sub>D </sub>176 &#x003bc;M; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]), were in a similar range like FGF2. The value of 1.2 for the number of independent ATP-binding sites of FGF2 showed that one molecule of FGF2 binds one molecule of ATP. This is in line with MALDI-TOF experiments where binding of one molecule of ATP to one molecule of FGF2 was demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Only in the presence of magnesium two molecules of ATP were able to bind to FGF2. Comparing the K<sub>D </sub>value of FGF2/ATP (K<sub>D</sub>: 60 &#x003bc;M) with FGF2/HSPGs (K<sub>D</sub>: 1-50 nM, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]) demonstrated that the binding of HSPGs to FGF2 was preferred.</p><p>Although the dissociation constant of ATP-binding to FGF2 was rather high, this binding leads to a significant change in the secondary structure of FGF2 as demonstrated by CD-spectroscopy (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Thereby the amplitude of structural change depends on the number of phosphate residues of the nucleotides (ATP &#x0003e; ADP &#x0003e; AMP). Interestingly, the conformational change after ATP-binding to FGF2 was more distinct than that of heparin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and may explain the physiological importance for neuroprotective activity of FGF2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>It has been known for many years that binding of heparin or HSPGs to FGF2 forces the dimerization of the growth factor and that this is important for interaction with its specific receptors ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). In contrast to heparin, ATP did not lead to a dimerization of FGF2 as observed in cross-linking experiments (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, lane 5). It could be speculated that ATP is not involved in receptor activation by dimerization. More important seems to be the protective effect of this abundantly present nucleotide on FGF2. This is in line with recent data showing that the main role of heparin or HSPGs in FGF1-induced signaling is to protect this naturally unstable protein from heat and proteolytic degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>The ATP binding capacity of the mutant FGF2 (K134A) is reduced by about 20% compared to wt-FGF2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Adding ATP to FGF2 (K134A) did not show additional protective effects against degradation by NE (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Furthermore, mutant FGF2 (K134A) did not show neuroprotective activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. It could be speculated that the not observed protectivity of ATP on FGF2 (K134A) is important for the loss of neuroprotectivity of this variant form of the growth factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Besides the protection of FGF2 by bound ATP from proteolytic digestion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], we demonstrated in this work that ATP additionally protects FGF2 from physical degradation. It is known that FGF2 is rapidly degraded when incubated in aqueous solution without stabilizers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. This is the main problem in the use of this important growth factor for medical applications. Observing the stability of FGF2 in buffered aqueous solution over a period of 2 hours clearly showed a protective effect of ATP bound to FGF2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). However, this protective effect was not as strong as observed with heparin; heparin protected FGF2 nearly completely from physical degradation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This decreased effect on the stability of FGF2 by ATP compared to heparin might be explained by the higher dissociation constant of ATP (59.8 &#x003bc;M) in contrast to heparin (1-50 nM).</p><p>The CD-data clearly demonstrate that the number of phosphate residues of the nucleotide (AMP, ADP, and ATP) is very important for the conformational change of the growth factor. Therefore we investigated the effect of FGF2-stabilization by different ligands exhibiting phosphate residues in the range of 2-6 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The results show that the number of negatively charged groups is important for the protective effect against proteolysis. However, thereby it was not taken into account that each substance has a different structure with different distances between the phosphate residues.</p><p>Taken together our results indicate that the binding affinity of ATP to FGF2 is moderate, but has a high impact on the secondary structure of the protein. This change in secondary structure might be the reason for the observed effect of ATP on the FGF2-stability, which could be classified between non-protected-FGF2 and a full-protection by FGF2/heparin-complex. Interestingly, the protective effect of ATP (0.1 mM) on FGF2 could also be detected after addition of 0.1 mM MgCl<sub>2 </sub>leading to the formation of the physiologically important ATP/Mg<sup>2+</sup>-complex (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Such a ATP/Mg<sup>2+</sup>-complex (molar ratio 1:1) is the predominant form of extracellular ATP in tissue.</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Stabilization of FGF2 by ATP/Mg<sup>2+</sup>-complex</bold>.
