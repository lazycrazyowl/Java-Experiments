This is a project to play with some NLP technologies outside of UIMA.
I've been working on scaling UIMA pipelines over SGE and want to see
how that works with Hadoop. The pipelines at work use SGE to link
the analysis engines and move annotations from one to another. 
In order to understand sesame better, I want to experiment with
using triples to store the annotations instead of UIMA.
